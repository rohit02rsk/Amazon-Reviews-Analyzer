    "0": "I got a good deal on them for black Friday for $99.  I'm going to review these as if they were full price because most of the time others will get that pricing.  I may have given them 3 stars if I paid full price.  I will make a long-form review and give quick points.  It's just a lot of money and I want to be thorough for anyone reading this considering a purchase.There are plenty of reviews that give some of the bigger points about this and I'd say a lot of them led me correctly.  My biggest fear with this set was the wires that hold the cups to the headband.  They look very flimsy and not durable, I was very skeptical when reviews say they are sturdy.  I can confidently say that is no longer a concern of mine.  They are surprisingly strong.My new concern with the build is the wire that connects the two parts.  I find myself needing to be very careful when taking them off so my finger doesn't catch on them and pull on the wire.  I did get used to that but it's worth noting.  I wager if any part of the build will fail, it's that wire.The microphone by default sounds really bad.  You can tweak it in the app, and then it sounds okay.  This is not the headset for people who will use the mic a lot.  There is no indicator that you are muted except the button height.  The attachment mic with the pop filter makes a light indicator difficult to do, but I notice myself talking as if I'm unmuted to myself.The range is very impressive.  I can go across my house and if there is nothing between me and the receiver it works really well.  When I do go behind a wall and it does lose connection it has no delay when it gets back in range to get the music back.*However, this comes to my biggest gripe about this headset.  Despite the range being great, sitting right in front of my computer, I will sometimes have moments of bad audio quality and it will even disconnect about 1-2 times per day.  I use my computer for most of the day.  It happens once every ~4-6 hours of use.  That is something that is really concerning to me.Other than that, the audio quality is very good, however, it does seem quieter than my previous headset.  This doesn't bother me because of the next point.The noise cancellation is impressive.  My house can get pretty loud and if I'm listening to music, it blocks out much of that noise.  If someone talks to you, you have no idea.  Without listening to music, I'd say about 65% - 75% of the noise is blocked out passively.It finds a great balance between being light and tight, but very comfortable.  It is very secure on my head.  The cups are a little small.  They are deep enough and padded enough that the depth doesn't bother me.  The width is wide enough, but it's somewhat close to being too narrow.I wish it had some macro/media keys on it.  The play/pause, skip, and back media keys are all done by using the power button with different pressing patterns.  This makes the time needed to hold the power button to turn on and off longer than I wish, and that's extra stress on that one button.  But it does work well.I do wish that it was USB-C, but the micro USB holds in place very securely and I suspect that's the reason they chose that type of cable.  It takes about 3.5 hours to charge.  The battery lasts me about a day and a half of my use.  I wish that was longer, but that is the nature of battery technology right now.  Much more would make the headset heavy.*However, the app does not tell you the fill percentage of the headset battery.  You only have maybe 10 pixels to visualize how full it is.  While it's charging it has a charge animation that makes it so you only know it's charging, and the only way to know exactly how full it is is by unplugging it.  That is a silly problem to have and I hope they fix it.  I can't believe they haven't fixed that yet.  I have read that the same app has battery fill percentages on their mice.Overall, I would say it's a good headset, but I did expect better from a headset of this price.  Overall it's a great headset if you ignore the major problem with it disconnecting within 2 feet from the transmitter.  But that is also a big issue for a headset to have.",
    "1": "The two major drawbacks of this headset were the range and sound quality. Now, quality is subjective, so I can't really fault it for not standing up to studio headsets like HD600 and ATH70x. But from a gaming headset perspective, I would have expected some better quality. Mostly the range was the killing blow. I couldn't walk across my room without it blipping and disconnecting, even within line of sight of the connector. And the same USB port was fine with my EPOS 370 or Corsair Virtuoso plugged in, and anything BT just put the range to shame.For the range reason alone, I am returning the product. I work from home and need to be able to walk around while on the phone or go to the kitchen or do my laundry all while listening in on a conference call.If range isn't that important to you and if you aren't an audiophile, then these may be very worth it. Here are some of the things that I really wish my ultimate choice headphone had:+ Volume knob is super easy to feel operate. I'm never catching my hair in it while I try and operate it.+ The build really feels high quality. The textured nature of the plastic has a premium touch and it just feels like a quality set. The way it is shaped and adjusts is unique. I could also take it on and off very easily with my long hair not catching at all (partly due to the use of cloth instead of leatherette). Notably, I could adjust them without grabbing my hair. These are the only headphones I've worn that made me feel very confident that I wasn't going to pull my hair while doing so. That was actually super comforting.+ The power button functions as a pause/play/answer/hangup button! That was actually amazing and I found myself using it quite a bit. I really REALLY wish this was a feature on any of my other headsets.+ The mic was removable and easy to add back. I have the Corsair Virtuoso, and the removable mic is difficult to get on and off. I do go through long periods of gaming where I'm not going to be talking to anyone, so having the option to just remove the mic is a good one. But I don't find myself removing that one due to having to take the headphone off just to get the mic on. The BlackSharks, however, could more easily get the Mic back in without much issue.These are not the most comfortable headphones I've owned (that actually goes to the Soundcore Q35 and second to my ATH70x, which is wired). But I easily found myself going all day with them while at work without an issue. They didn't feel like they needed a breaking in period.Minor gripe that may be big for others: micro USB. Like I had gotten rid of everything else that was micro USB. All my other devices are USB-C, which makes it super easy to charge things from a set of the same cables. So why? I could have overlooked this for the fact that the battery was seemingly good from the beginning.Minor plus: the microphone right out of the box was actually good at reducing background noise, though it didn't sound that great to begin with. NVIDIA Broadcast app is like cheat-mode for removing background noise, and I run that all the time. So, this was a small thing to consider, but just out of the box, it could keep down the sound of my mechanical keyboard to a minimum, which was not something any other headset had seemed to be do. Props to that.Ultimately the sound quality was so pale compared to the EPOS 370's which were (for me at the time) $40 cheaper. That and the range was enough for me to return these, even with a super convenient shape for me and the pause/play button I found myself using a TON. I use that all the time on my Soundcore Q35's. But still, it's a return for me. Again, if range isn't a problem (you'll just be sitting at your desk or on the sofa across from the TV) and you're not spoiled by audiophile-ish cans, then these should be just fine if not on the pricy side for something with micro-USB still.",
    "2": "This headset is great. They sounded okay before I used the software. The Razer software really gave these headphones a good boost in sound quality when I used the THX and turned on Windows Sonic. The mic is pretty good. Nothing to brag about. but it will do the job. I havent used the mic much because I already have a USB Condenser mic thats quite good. So I got this headset just for gaming. The battery is really good too. I play a lot over the weekend and if I charge the headset friday night, it gets me through the day all day Saturday and Sunday without a recharge. I've had it for about 4 months now and its still going strong. The one thing I'm not a fan of is the metal extensions that make the headset fit larger heads. its hard to keep make them even on your head. you can extend them so it fits your head more comfortably, and it will be even, but after I wear them for a couple days, one side is always longer than the other and puts a bit more weight on that side of your head. Kind of annoying but its not a big deal at all since I can just readjust them.",
    "3": "I've been using this for over a year. Its a well rounded product. The wireless works great at an average distance and the sound is average. The surround sound works well, even without THX audio enabled, making it a good gaming headset. The noise cancellation works well, as I have a very loud computer and I can't notice it with the headset on.The only issues I've encounted with this product:- The volume dial on the left side of the headset slightly breaks over time. There is a notch which allows the volume dial to sit at a default level. However, if left there for long enough, the sound will go out in the opposite ear which forces you to re-adjust the volume and then the problem goes away. Not really that big of an issue, but kind of an annoyance. This will only happen if you leave the volume dial in the default position for long enough, slightly adjusting it in either direction fixes the issue permanantly if you never put back in the default position.- Razer drivers suck. Razer, please, nobody is going to know what your THX audio means, and its hard to configure (especially when using an audio setup such as Voicemeeter). I never got THX audio to work the way I think it should work. It seemingly dulls the sound, if I can even get it to work. I'm a software engineer, so none of that should be hard for me, but it is. Using the default headset audio device instead of the THX audio device in your Windows settings works just fine.Overall a well rounded product. Would reccomend as an average well rounded headset.",
    "4": "I've been using these for a couple of months now, both for gaming and for online meetings where my voice is very important.The sound quality is as good as any other headphones I've had, and better than most. I get about the same performance out of these as I do from my AKG studio headphones, in terms of volume and clarity. I'm not much of an audiophile, so I can't comment too much on sound quality.They're comfortable, both initially and after wearing them for hours. My janky old headset got very loose and would fall off, and despite its weight, this headset stays in place just fine. I find that my ears only really get tired after 7 or 8 hours, which is longer than I like to wear headphones anyway. I also have bigger ears than most, so you might have less fatigue than I do.On noise cancellation, be aware that these DON'T have any active noise cancellation. They're closed-back headphones, so they'll muffle the noise around you, and they do a better job of that than my previous janky headset. However, don't expect to take these on an airline flight to drown out engine noise.The wireless mode works perfectly. I have my computer set up in a way where I can either use it on a desk with a normal monitor, or connected to a TV. In the latter case, I am generally sitting across the room (about 20 feet away) from the computer. I had some trouble with the wireless cutting out when I had the USB receiver connected to the back of the PC, so the signal had to travel through the case and components. But with the receiver on the front of my PC, I've had no issues at all. The signal even generally works through my apartment walls, with minimal cutout.Battery life is fine. I can use the headphones for a full work day without having to plug them in, which sometimes means 10-12 hours. I haven't had the headphones long enough to know how the batteries age, but I have my fingers crossed.The physical controls are pretty nice, with a mute button that's reasonably easy to use, and a nice big volume knob. There's a weird problem with the monitor (more on that later) which means that I don't actually use the volume knob much when I'm using my voice for one reason or another. However, it's smooth, heavy, and gives you good volume control.Main downsides:The microphone that comes with the headset is clear but strangely weak. You should be able to replace it with any similar single-channel detachable mic, but for an expensive high-end headset, I don't understand why my 15-year-old, $20 headset has a better mic. I had to go into the settings and boost my max out my output volume for anyone to be able to hear me. Even so, people I talk to on Discord say they still have to turn the volume up to hear me.The \"noise isolation\" of the microphone is just a cardioid pickup pattern, which almost every headset has. If someone is talking in the same room as you, this mic is still going to pick them up.Finally, the headphones DO have a monitor function, so you don't feel like you're underwater while you talk. However, the volume on the feature is stupidly low, and its volume is controlled by the volume knob on the headphones. To hear myself while I speak, I have to have the monitor turned up to 100% in the software, and I also have to turn the volume knob on the headphones all the way up, then turn down my computer volume. With those measures, it works reasonably well, but this is probably something that Razer could easily fix, or even patch in the software. If you don't care about the monitor, then feel free to ignore this, but if you like having a monitor on your mic, then this is going to be frustrating for you.Overall, I don't regret getting this headset, especially because the wireless function was important for my physical setup. However, I feel like a big company like Razer shouldn't give you a product with so many problems that you have to fix yourself.",
    "5": "The things that really stand out with this headset are the noise cancelling ear muffs. They cancel noise out very well. The mic is respectable. The software is acceptable. The one thing that brings a star down for me is the connection distance. It is not very good. I traded out my RIG 800 for these. The connection distance for the RIGS is phenominal. These were slightly underwhelming in that ai could be 10-15ft away and already am having disconnection. Other than that. They are decent.",
    "6": "I finally got rid of my logitech POS's. I had the g935sThis headset \"Once you configure the sound\" is just a fantastic headset.The mute options on the headset are very nice.The sound mute option on the headset is also very nice and convenient.The connection speed from the headset to the USB is ridiculously fast.ONLY gripe I have with this headset is the range. It's very low. Walking out of my office which is a 12x8 1/4 inch concrete board leaving the door open. I can get about ten feet from the transmitter. Forget going into my house with it from my mancave. The logitech headset beats it here. I used to be able to walk around my house and still be connected with the Logitech one.This headset is worth the buy.",
    "7": "Let me preface by stating I am reviewing the Blackshark v2 pro. Sometimes amazon combines similar item reviews, this is important and that I have owned this for over a year with consistent usage, using it multiple days a week for 1-8 hours.This thing has a lot going for it with very few downsides that in my opinion do not outweigh the pros and if you can get this for $150 or less it is 100% worth it.Pros- Noise cancellation is so strong, sometimes I don't hear my wife when she calls for me. She was the one who bought this for me lol- Sound quality through synapse can be adjusted to your liking, and I can't recommend it without it (kind of a con)- Incredibly comfortable even with glasses. There is a lot of good padding on the head and ears, prior headsets this was always an issue, recently before this I owned a corsair void elite and even that wasn't perfect, but it was close in this category.- Battery life is actually really strong, just be sure to charge it after each usage. I've only ever gotten this to low battery where it beeps at me if I use it for 10-12 hours without charging it. Sometimes thats a long gaming day sometimes thats multiple days. I'm pretty good about keeping things charged, so this isn't a pain point for me, but may be for you. That said you can charge while using it.- Removable microphone, probably not a huge deal for most, but I use these as headphones not a headset. I use an external USB mic for better quality (I'll get into that later).- Ability to use this with 3.5mm port. I wouldn't recommend this without the USB function, as the USB DAC it comes with is decent enough and having used it without it, this is where it fails, but I'm labeling the 3.5mm port as a pro in case you have a multipurpose headset in mind- THX 7.1, now this is just virtual surround sound but in the couple games I have tried, notably monster hunter world, it performs really well, its weird to get used to but its done well enough. Not a huge selling point, you can get this elsewhere, but noted.Cons- Without the USB DAC and synapse you are losing a lot of potential. This thing is really good for sound quality once you configure it, but on it's own it's horrible, this is why I did not get the wired version of the blackshark v2 with just 3.5mm.- Microphone quality isn't great, its honestly worse than most and for $180 it should be a lot better, this is why I use an external mic. Unless you're yelling, your friends will probably say you're quiet.- Intermittent disconnects, unsure if this is a hardware, connection or synapse issue but it happens infrequently it doesn't bother me, but should be noted.- Synapse, I swear I've had issues with every gaming software (ghub, icue, synapse) but recently synapse has been a pain. I love iCUE (or did) but hate corsair software, but if synapse continues to get worse I will look elsewhere for another headset.Overall, if I had to buy this thing again I'd do it for $130 or so. I wouldn't spend $180, I'd just get professional wired headphones, but this thing has a lot going on that it made it worth it to me. I recommend these headphones to anyone who is in the market for a wireless headset in this budget range who doesn't hold grudges against razer. In that niche, I think its perfect.",
    "8": "I use headsets mostly for discord, playing survival games, and listening to music—and although I would not classify myself as an audiophile, I can appreciate some degree of layering, and I certainly enjoy my bass.  What I want in a wireless headset is comfort, lasting build quality, clear mic, good sound, and good range (tall order, I know, but I can dream).  I am aware that wireless headsets are mostly not yet comparable in quality to wired headsets, I don't think technology is far off and I like being able to stay in conversation or listening to music while making food in the kitchen. In the end, I returned this headset after one month's use as the mic suddenly stopped working one morning when it was working perfectly the previous night.  I tried to have the issue resolved to no avail and gave up.  I simply did not want to push it when it failed me after one month with subpar range and sound quality.  Read on for my in-depth ratings on each feature this headset has to offer.THE GOODComfort - 5 starsI liked the ear cuff size and material, the material is a breathable mesh which I have come to prefer after using this headset as it does not cause irritation around my ears like other leather-like materials tend to do.  The build is overall light but surprisingly sturdy.  I feel that these qualities allowed me to use them for long periods of time comfortably, which can go on for even 12+ hours sometimes (I am an artist so sometimes I get in the zone especially while listening to music).Volume Knob - 5 starsI also liked the volume knob, it has a middle divet so you always know where 50% is.  It has just the right amount of resistance to not get accidentally bumped but still turn the dial effortlessly.  I like the placement, easy to reach, but not in the way.Battery Life - 4.5 starsBattery life was great, I had only a couple times where battery was low during gaming sessions, in which case I was able to simply plug it in for charging and still use it at the same time.Mobile Wire - 5 starsI also like the feature of the included 3.5mm jack so I could use my headset with my phone, which came in handy if I wanted to be in discord while making food in the kitchen as the range does not reach too well.THE MEHMic Quality - 2 starsMy friends did not note anything spectacular about my mic sound quality, but it got the job done and they could hear me just fine.  I was previously using a Razer Nari Essential prior, so maybe there were no significant changes to their mic technology.  However, the mic mysteriously stopped working altogether for me after a month.  I did everything I could to try to resolve it, but to no avail.  I didn't want to keep a pair of $170 headphones so I have since returned them.Sound Quality - 2.5 starsThe sound quality of the headphones are definitely subpar out of the box so you will want to download the program (I am personally unaware if other programs will work just as well).  The preset options weren't amazing so it took some messing around to get it to something decent, but I imagine that audiophiles would rate the overall sound quality below average.  The bass wasn't perfect but it did the job for me, I didn't sense a whole lot of layering in music unless I really strained myself to listen for them.  I am not good at anything music-related but to me it seemed like there were blurry lines defining the sounds.  Perhaps for that reason I did not experience immersion in my games anymore than the nari essential did.THE BADWireless Range - 2 starsFinally, my qualms with this headset... the range of this wireless headset was not amazing.  My kitchen is maybe 15 feet from my room and the connection starts getting spotty once I enter the kitchen, and drops completely after two more feet.  I was only able to get the extra two feet before dropping after moving the dongle from the back of my computer to the front.Mute Button - 2 starsWhile I like the way the mute button pops in when muted and is popped out unmuted, the mute button is, in my opinion, poorly located.  Even after a month I still had struggles reaching for the mute button sometimes despite being raised.  It is just an awkward placement.  There is no other indicator that you are muted unless you can feel whether the mute button is raised or pushed in.THX Spatial - 1 starI did not care for this feature at all.  I tried it with discord, music, and games, but all it did for me was muddy up sounds and make voices have a weird echo.",
    "9": "I've had these and used these for over almost a year. I love them but after a year and a couple of drops the wireless range from the usb is terrible. I can tilt my head at my pc and it will disconnect then come back very sad that going to have to buy a new pair to fix it but these still work but it get very irritating disconnecting then connecting when playing games.",
    "10": "What more can you ask for? I use this headset quite a bit and its always comfortable. I not only game but I work from home, as a supervisor I have 4-5 meetings every single day so I use this headset for at least 7-8 hours each day. It has enough battery life to stay wireless the entire day and to ensure I can game at night I simply charge it while I'm at lunch. I've never actually gotten a \"low battery\" notice. Now, that's all great but how they sound is probably even more important. I LOVE how these sound. They have good bass without being ridiculous and boomy like some gaming headphones. They have fantastic directional sound for games and I enjoy the overall sound quality/profile. Another great feature for me is the mic. This is a GREAT mic. As I stated earlier I run quite a few meetings and my teams immediately noticed how much better I sounded once I started using this headset. It does well blocking out background noise yet ensuring I sound crisp. Overall, for under $150 I just don't see there being a better wireless headset option. To get something better you're going to be spending well over $200 and more than likely into the $300 range. My ONE complaint is the mute button. It is quite sensitive and its right next to the power button which you need to hold for a few seconds to turn on. This causes me to accidently mute myself when attempting to turn on the headset. its a minor annoyance but still... I'd have moved the mute button to the other cup or at least away from the power button. Overall, for me, this headset has been great. I wear it nearly all day every day and it still looks brand new. If you're looking for an affordable gaming headset that sounds great and has battery life to run all day I absolutely recommend the Blackshark V2.",
    "11": "The range is ok. I need about 10 feet more to cover my home but I love the mobility.  They are comfortable and are rather light.  People can hear me well through the microphone.I use an external equalizer I already have to channel what I want I hear from each monitor and the way I want to hear it. I'm pleased with this purchase.",
    "12": "Overall for gaming I give it 5 stars, nothing at all to complain about and the sound quality is excellent as well as is the spatial sound.  For general use, perfect.  Very comfortable, even more so than my other headset which was twice the cost (Corsair Virtuoso RGB XT).  For musical listening, if you are an 'audiophile' or just someone who puts a lot of value on musical sound quality, this headset will require some fine tuning to sound great.  Fortunately, the Razer application this headset uses has a built in adjustable EQ that is capable of handling this task based on your preferences and input.  After going through and adjusting the EQ while listening to some reference tracks I am familiar with, the headset performs quite admirably for musical content as well.",
    "13": "I got this headset about 4 or 5 months ago. Is a comfortable, sturdy and I like the style. And I like a lot the headset.However, my biggest concern about this headset. Despite im sitting right in front of my computer, 2 or 3 ft between the headset and the receiver, I will sometimes have moments of bad audio quality and it will even disconnect about 1-2 times per day. It happens once every ~4-6 hours of use. I dont if this is related to the battery charge or something. I just know this is something that is really concerning to me.",
    "14": "The sound is great and I don't feel any delay.But the noise reduction is bad,when others talking next to me(about 1 feet away),i can hear clearly.Also the Bluetooth is not as good as the Hyper x Cloud Flight Wireless,when i wore the cloud flight and go to the toilet (just next to my room about few feet and have a thin wall)it won't have any connection problems.But with the blackshark V2 Pro,it will just disconnected.",
    "15": "THX isn't that good, but great quality anyways, 10/10 Packaging, 10/10 For gaming, Last long hours. Decent product.",
    "16": "This head set is worth the money in my opinion.  The audio is awesome, it’s perfect for someone with glasses (like me), and the comfort is immaculate. The only down side is that the mic is vary crappy but I use a blue yeti as my primary mic so that doesn’t bother me.",
    "17": "These are beautiful headphones that seem sturdy built. The ear cups fit nicely and are great at noise cancellation. The sound quality is decent and has enough range and some bass.The wireless range is very lacking. I live in a fairly small house and I start to lose connection 20 ft away in the kitchen and forget it down the hall in the bedroom. I have a pair of uncomfortable Beats Solo 3 that can reach no problem so these are a bit of a disappointment.I don’t love the mic design, I think a hard plastic arm would have paired better, it’s hard to get it right for people to clearly hear me and it’s hard to get out of my eye sight.I wish the charging port was designed like their Basilisk Pro mouse with a nice coupling system, I struggle to plug it in every time, I expect this will be a point of failure over time as it doesn’t prevent poor angles.I don’t like the power function, too long of a hold to turn them on and off.",
    "18": "Another Update: If you are noticing that these headphones sound lousy on your PC, muddy mid tones and non crisp audio, simply uninstall Razer Synapse and they will sound SO much better.  I spent hours fiddling around with the EQ settings and I could never get them right even though they sound fantastic on my PS5.  By uninstalling Synapse and just running these direct from the USB dongle, they sound so much more clear and crisp.Also, if you're using windows, download Dolby atmos and just keep it on the default settings.  I found that gives the most crisp, full, 3d audio that sounds fantasticYou can use Dolby Atmos through windows if you want to tweek the sound and get 3D audio and it even has an EQ so you have the best of both worlds.  This should dramatically improve the audio qualityUpdate: had these things for a few months and I still love them!  They work great on my PS5 as well as my PC although it can get a little difficulty finding the right EQ settings and changes to them will drastically improve or degrade the sound. All in all, five out of five product----These things are amazing! I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that were compatible with the 3D sound on my PS5.  With the included dongle, these things are basically just plug and play; both my PS5 and PC effortless and quickly recognize the headphones when they are turned on.I'm not an audiophile, but audio in music and games is important to me.  These things really shine especially at this price point and the fact that they are wireless.  When I first tested them on my PS5, I wasn't blown away with the 3D audio, until I switched by to my old but high quality sanheauser headphones.  WOW what a difference in audio quality and spatial awareness.As with any good headphones, you're not getting the most out of them if you're not properly equalizing them.  The headphones come with decent presets (on the synapse PC app) but I've included a better equalization in the picture.  Switch between the default preset and this and you will really hear how well these headphones can shine with proper equalization.  Very clear tones with rich bass!The headphones are high quality.  They do have a light grip on your head and and they will move around on your head, but for a person who wears glasses this is a good thing since they dramatically increase the comfort level and reduce the change of your glasses causing pressure points. The material on the headphones is a little spongy to finger prints but not a big deal.The only thing that makes me nervous is the USB dongle situation.  I would really like to order an extra dongle since I hope to take these between my PC and my PS5, so I worry if i lose this I will be out of luck.  I bought a third party usb dongle but I can't connect them, so I think you are stuck with the factory Razer dongle that doesn't seem easy to replace.  Not a negative, just a small drawback. I would feel much better if I could either buy a replacement dongle on razers website (you can't at the moment) or have the ability to connect to a third party dongleFor 170, these seem like a screaming deal.  It's so much nicer playing on my PC now with fewer wires and they sound as good if not better than my wired headphones.  I'd highly recommend these",
    "19": "First I want to preface by saying I just tested this for an hour at time of writing, but I will update after 30 days. This is my first Razor headset ever as I steered clear because of build quality, but this headset won me over...Pros:-Best sound I have had on a wireless (gaming) headset and I have plenty, this is right under the steelseries arctis pro wireless which I did have for a test.-Good build quality and the metal hinges are super tight, some have had loose fitting ones, mine did not have those.-comfort, this is comparable to my arctis 7 2019 with brainwavz. I am going to mod some brainwavz on these too. The earpads are fine for most people stock though.-mic quality is very good, maybe the best I have heard on a wireless set, but this also leads to a small con as well which I will cover below.-razor synapse is good, I jumped in and set a v eq and then tested the gaming preset which was good also. Very good customizing here, gotta have an adjustable eq for me before I'm buying it.-battery life, TBD but it is very loud and advertises 20+ hours. No problems with it being quiet on pc and Ps5.-clarity is superb and thx is very good for my purposes.Cons-it did not clip sound (distort) until I pre-amped it, but it really isn't needed. It did clip sound on ps5 if I maxed the USB up, but leave it at 90% and you should be good.-mic is a huge one, it's a cardioid style mic and it is pretty big, but it does have very good quality once dialed in with Synapse.-no THX on ps5, but 3d sound works just fine. On PC this is very high end sound imo as this can hit some really good kHz 28k and is near Hifi.-no USB C and is only micro USB, just a small gripe, not deducting from what this headset does.-will work on Xbox only if wired, but the 3.5mm cable Razor supplied is a nice braided L cable.-volume knob is huge, but that's aesthitics which is fine for most.Overall: If you have the money to spend a little more than 100 I would get this if your primary use is Pc/Ps5. This headset stomps the pulse 3d wireless and is better than my Arctis 7 2019 for my purposes of use. This will work wired as well, but I have not tested on Xbox. I will update after 30 days of use. Razor has made an exceptional headset here and this is going to be between Arctis 7 and this being my daily driver. Btw, I have large ears and this is still over the ear for me and is super comfy.Update Feb 4th: battery life, sound and comfort is still great. It sounds great wired on my series X using DTS sound unbound. The drivers have broke in a little bit and battery life is around 24 to 25 hours at about 65% volume. These get as loud as my gen3 A50's. Build quality should be fine as I don't see any failure points for my use and I baby these and keep them on a headset holder. These are still 5 star for me.Update 03/09/2021:The Blackshark V2 Pro is still working fine and I have used this on my Series X (wired), PS5 (wired and wireless), and pc (wired and wireless). Battery life has been around 23 to 24 hours as the volume is kept around 70%. Mic has been fine when used on all platforms and the comfort after these have broken in is second only to my Arctis 7, which both are close in comfort. Nothing faulty and build has held up very well. I will say that it is a pain to change earpads, but other than that it's still a very good headset.",
    "20": "Almost perfect.. it does say it works for xbox.. witch it does, just can't use the wireless feature on the Xbox. The wireless feature only works on PC.",
    "21": "I was NOT expecting it to require a dedicated USB dongle.  Although it likely uses a Bluetooth signal it is proprietary through the included USB Dongle.  You can't just pair it up with your existing Bluetooth and will need to have a open USB port (Type A) to plug it into.However, I kind of like this approach as the dongle loads as a HID (human interface device).  So for me, that means I don't have to turn on my Bluetooth.  From a computer standpoint this has some marked performance improvement.So it worked for me, and I considered taking away a star for this but decided not to.One thing that is good is you can use it wired.  But this can be complicated if you don't have a combined stereo and mic port (4 segment plug).  My computer has these separate which requires you get the proper adapter cable so it \"Y\" connects to the Speaker and Mic jacks.  But again, I like the dongle wireless connection.Sound is fantastic, Full and Rich.Mic is outstanding, very directional so you don't pic up a lot of stray noises and what people hear on the other end is simply great quality.Very cushy headset, comfortable but likely be a little hot on a hot day.  That is something that is typical of any headphone... but overall these are super comfortable.The mic is removable, just unplugs from the headset or you can mute the mic with a button on the headset.  Both are great features.I used them for 3 hours with zero issues, not sure how long the battery will last as this was as long as I needed.  However if the battery is low you can always plug them in (standard usb cord) and charge them while you wear them.I was disappointed in the fact that you can't USB cord connect the speakers/mic.  Seemed something they should have done...  Maybe I will deduct a star.But I am very happy with them for what I use them for, and would recommend them to others.  Just need to understand the limitations... and that should be clearer in sales promotions too.",
    "22": "Purchased these headphones for my grandson for his (21st) birthday.  He loves them. Better quality than previously purchased headphones. Impressed by comfort of ear pads, as he spends many hours gaming daily. Told me, grandma you chose wisely.  Many hours researching gaming headphones paid off. He’s happy so I’m happy.",
    "23": "Wireless headphones get a bad reputation but this one has performed very well for the 15 months I've had it. I use it a few hours a day and usually only have to charge it once a week.  The only downside abt the battery is it takes a while to fully charge. The microphone is good for being wireless, not the best but you can adjust the settings in the app. The app is what makes this a good buy, out the box the mic and sound quality will be off but then you van adjust how you see fit. Works well enough on consoles though pc is where you want to use this. And game quality is also very good, not the best but you are not paying 500$ and you can adjust what you want to hear anyways. The only negatives are the connectivity range, I can only go to rooms if there is a open wall or I start losing connection. You can't go outside and walk around talking on the mic. And there is bleed, at abt 50% headphone volume and 100% app volume when playing a song if the song is at a loud part you can hear a little bleed, not an issue if there is other noises around you but if you plan to use this in a quiet setting just be aware or turn the app volume down. Not completely soundproof, you can still hear talking when at low volumes and at higher volumes you can still hear banging and yelling unless you have everything max volume.",
    "24": "TLDR: So far so good!  Only used them for a few hours but set up was easy and I love the product so far.I was a little disappointed in years prior when spending BIG bucks on wireless headphones.  I wont mention brand names but even well reviewed devices caused me bad luck.  I spent LOTS of time reading reviews and toiled over how much to spend and what would be both easy to use and sound really good.  I think my search paid off because thats exactly what I got with this product.I just started using the BlacksharkV2 Pro but for one... the set up IS actually as easy as advertised.I charged the device as instructed.  Put the wireless dongle in the USB3.0 hub of my laptop.  The software just installed on its own.I didnt have to break my brain tweaking windows preferences everything just did what the isntructions said it would.  Following them was easy.Im not an expert level computer technician and the software is very intuitive.  It automatically detects when the device is connected and you can customize settings on the fly.  And there arent TOO many complicated settings to tweak.  So maybe expert level users would be turned off.  But for me its \"just right\"... enough for me to feel satisfied in the tweaking I would expect from a higher end product but not so much that its stressful to use.  I booted up Madden, played with settings for about 5 minutes and was gaming from that point on.  As far as what settings do... I knew what I was measing with and what I didnt know was easily explained right there on the software.  Im so impressed with the software that Im considering using this brand for other devices.These are first impressions but the sound quality is quite nice.  Im no audio freak but the quality exceeds expectations, especially after messing with the settings.Functionality is fine.  With wireless headphones I expect the controls to be on the headset itself.  This means the buttons are small and tight together by nature, but this design is as convenient as i think it could be.  The mute button feels good and is easy to hit.  The volume control dial is easy to find on your head.  The features advertised work well and didnt let me down.My only gripe is that I had some trouble with the detachable mic.  I have the settings fully cranked up on my mic output and its STILL a touch low on dischord for my team mates.  I had some issues getting it to face the right way but once I did I found the quality acceptable.  The actual connection from the mic to the headset isnt all that sturdy so it took some fiddling at first but I havent had problems since I positioned it how I like.  The downside is that it somewhay defeats the purpose of having a detachable mic if the set up is so fiddly that it has to be JUST RIGHT every time.I always get worried with devices like headphones that they look differently than pictured.  These cans are as sleek as I expected.  No surprise silly flashy lights like my last pair.  Theyre nice and comfy on my head.  For me its a perfect balance of snugging to my head while moving around a little without causing too much uncomfortable pressure.",
    "25": "Probably one of the best headphones I have ever had for a great price. The sound is amazing. The fact that it's wireless is awesome since my computer is attached to my TV and I sit back pretty far. I would give this product a 10 out of 10 if I could.",
    "26": "I finally needed a new headset after my 7 year old HyperX Cloud 2 began showing signs of wear.  I wanted a wireless headset and heard good things about this one.  I got it on sale for $100 which is a steal for most high quality headsets.Battery life is great, I am on my computer most of the day and a lot during the night.  I haven't calculated how many hours, but it lasts at least 3 days.  The one thing that is disappointing in the range.  I thought I could keep my headset one while listening to music/podcasts and grab a drink from the kitchen, but it's effective range is barely 15 feet.  And I had to plug it into the USB port on the front of my computer because it was getting interference when I plugged it into the back.First off, it is very comfortable, slightly heavier than my hyperx, but that is due to the drivers and battery.  The kicker for this headset is the Razer synapse software.  I have multiple Razer products and the software really makes this headset stand out.  It's great to have different settings for gaming, music, and movies/TV.  I can't give it 5 stars since it isn't has comfortable as my hyperx, but 4 stars is still a worthy purchase at $100.",
    "27": "When I got it in the mail it came packaged very well. The sound quality is amazing and it looks amazing and has cool features like a cool volume up and down on the side of the bud. Would recommend getting a used one because I got mine for 60 and it came like new but new it is 170 so I will not pay 170 but this headset is amazing a nice. It actually has an EQ for it too which is amazing if you want have bass boost or just clear sound.",
    "28": "Picked up the BlackShark V2 Pros recently, so far so good based on first impressions. These are definitely a step up as far as comfort, sound quality, and mic quality are concerned when compared to other Razer headsets. Note that the following review was typed out with the PC platform in mind, this headset will function wirelessly and via 3.5mm cable without THX audio support on PS4/PS5 but still takes advantage of 7.1 surround sound. As far as I can tell, these will not function via the wireless dongle on Xbox consoles but can still be used wired.Comfort: Easily the most comfortable headset I've ever worn, the earcups are breathable and the headset itself feels very lightweight with no noticeable amount of pressure on my head. Haven't noticed any sliding issues with the thin metal bars that allow for fit adjustment, they seem surprisingly sturdy given how precariously delicate they appear to be. For a Razer product, it's surprising to see no obvious problems with build quality.Sound Quality: Needs a bit of adjustment of the box via the Razer Synapse app. It took about five minutes to calibrate THX audio settings to my liking, but beyond that, everything sounds great! No complaints with bass, mids, and lows while listening to music or on Twitch/Youtube, the headset itself gets very loud on max volume with very little perceptible distortion. No in-game complaints so far either, the 7.1 surround sound seems to be properly calibrated for picking up low sounds such as footsteps and other audio prompts. To me, they sound almost as good as my Astro A50 Gen 4 headset for nearly half the price.Mic: Very good for a wireless headset microphone after adjusting ambient noise and voice clarity settings,, haven't had any complaints from friends and randoms on Discord. I do have a couple of issues with it though:- Mic sidetone is very quiet even at full volume. Not a deal breaker for me personally, but it could be for those who prefer a more audible sidetone.- Placement within the headset can be a bit cumbersome upon insertion; can be finicky and will not function unless placed and spun counterclockwise. Takes a bit of trial and error but will stay in place once properly fitted.Noise cancellation: Passive only, will not filter out loud noises at same level as most closed back headphones. This seems to be the trade off for having such a comfortable fit. However, neither myself nor my partner have noticed any audio bleed or speaker audio being picked up by the mic.Miscellaneous: note that the earcups are not removable or replaceable, which is a strange omission given that the Blackshark V2 wired variant has that option. Go with those instead if you don't mind the wires and are looking to customize or properly maintain the earcups. The Pro variant also charges via an included Micro USB, which may be a turnoff for those who have already fully converted over to USB Type C.Overall verdict: definitely worth the $160 spent, I can't recommend the BlackShark V2 Pro enough. When it comes to Razer's audio options, this is definitely the way to go as far as their wireless headsets are concerned. This review will be updated if any issues arise over time.",
    "29": "HyperX cloud is better. These aren’t horrible but they aren’t as loud, the volume knob on the left cup is stupid design choice and they aren’t as comfortable. I’ve never bought a Razer product and thought “Yeah this is worth the money.”",
    "30": "They are very comfortable and look great, battery life is good and the sound quality it's amazing, with a DAC or any other audio enhancer should be awesome.",
    "31": "I did mot notice much noise canceling besides just turning the volume up otherwise I got two pairs one for my son and one for me my son's was missing the aux cable but I was able to get these on Amazon warehouse clearance for $54 each so both for the price of one refurbished or two for the price of half of one. I would Gove 5 stars if everything was included and noise canceling was noticeably better.",
    "32": "To start, I’ve owned the Turltebeach 800x Elite, HyperX Cloud 2, Steelseries Arctic 9x and Pro, and now these, the BlackShark 2.Overall, this headset is easily my favorite. It’s light, comfortable, looks amazing, stays cool, has superb sound quality, and the mic input sounds almost as good as entry-mid level dedicated stream mics.I do wear glasses on occasion and this headset did not hinder or make wearing my glasses uncomfortable at all. They do fit snug around the ears which provides the only “noise cancellation” you’ll get. The only headset adjustment is the head size by pushing or pulling up on the ear cups which is pretty standard. There is some give where the headset does relax on your head over time but does so in a really gentle and gradual way which keeps ongoing gaming sessions comfortable. It never gives enough to feel like the headset is hanging on your head or resting on the top of your ears.In terms of sound I think this is the most balanced headset I’ve eased. No sound is too flat or too full. You can tell that you have room to do what you want with sound profiles which I do love. The THX option is wonderful for music and video media though I find it situational in gaming. I wouldn’t recommend that setting for shooters or fast paced gaming. I would personally prefer juuuuuuuuust a little bit more bass because even at max adjustments and with Bass Boost it sounds and feels juuust under the Mark you’d want. The game profiles you can set work perfectly and I highly recommend taking the time to fine tune profiles for the games you play. And example is that Rainbow Six Siege sounds so insanely flat that it needs a lot of audio work with this headset to give the game audio some life. If you left those settings on for Warzone you’d hate it, or if you moved over to something on the opposite end of the spectrum such as No Man’s Sky where you would want the THX profile. You spent the money, take the time.Lastly, features. I love the minimalistic approach with the one control knob on the headset. You do get a basic mute and power button on the same left ear up as well though they’re close together and feel the exact same so half the time you don’t mute yourself if you’re using the headset button and not a hot key. It is lacking active noise cancellation and/pass through audio capabilities so this is a headset that is definitely less usable for your phone, tablet, ect. Also, I do miss having the red light indicator on the mic boom that you get with SteelSeries Pro lines which you can always see in your peripheral vision which is hard to explain why that’s nice but it’s a miss for me:Overall, it’s built well, looks great, and gets you right to what you want which is an immersive audio experience. I would pick this over the headsets I’ve mentioned above easily.",
    "33": "I originally had a pair of Razer kraken wired headset but the cord had serious problems with twisting and tangling so I thought I’d give these ones a try. Let me just say this headset is the lightest one I’ve ever owned. It feels so comfortable and light I often forget I’m wearing it. The foam around the ears is so comfortable which is a big deal because I wear glasses. The battery lasts me about 2-3 days. I’m using them in 6-8 hour sessions. I love the clean cute look of the white as well.The sound for gaming is good location of enemies is clear and things sound very crisp. I really like the volume notch on the side for volume control especially for discord sessions. If you’re looking for an inexpensive wireless headset this is it.",
    "34": "Bought these for my son, who's an avid gamer. He absolutely loves them. Superior sound quality.",
    "35": "I have really enjoyed this headset, from quality to design. This headset has greatly improved my gaming experience.",
    "36": "I bought a second-hand earphone that looked very old and disgusting, so I bought a brand new one that was very comfortable to wear. I really like it",
    "37": "Absolutely love the freedom of it being wireless. The mic is great when I don't feel like using my Yeti (considerably not as good as my Yeti, but let's be honest - no headset mic is - and this is a good substitute when you're not recording videos).They are relatively lightweight for being wireless, also. Nicely cushioned arch going over the head, easy to use buttons on the side. Comes with a nice cloth bag to store them in for travel or storage.***I would have taken off a star because one of the headphone speakers died, but after I contacted Razer customer service (through official Razer support!), they ended up sending me a whole new (or refurbished) set, so yeah. Five stars.***",
    "38": "Great job",
    "39": "I got these for around $90 on Amazon Warehouse, and they were basically new, probably a return and if they paid full price I fully understand the return.At the price I paid, I’m pretty happy with the purchase, but had I paid full price, I would likely have returned them as well.The sound quality is great, on PC with the Razer software, and wired on my phone; not better than some Sennheiser Momentum’s I have, but quality nonetheless. The mic is good, I haven’t had complaints, again on my PC or phone.The ear pads don’t seem to be removable or replaceable, as I haven’t found any on sale on the Razer store and tried taking them off but they didn’t seem to want to go and I decided it best to give up. This is something I find acceptable at the price I paid, but not at the full price of these headphones.The ear pads are also a comfy breathable material, which is great inside with air conditioning, but if you plan to use these outside in a hot climate, and you sweat, that’s definitely getting absorbed into the pads. Which is why I went looking for replacements on the Razer store, hoping to find leather (synth or otherwise) replacements.The range is decent: great at the desk, which is to be expected; going 15-20 feet to my fridge causes them to do a “beep boop” sound, letting me know I’m getting out of range.Battery life is great. Has lasted me all day, and then some, before.The Razer software is good. I have other Razer products, and they are all adjustable through the same software suite. I found some parts of the suite unnecessary, but Synapse, which is the part that adjusts the headphones, is pretty good. You can change sound profiles based on applications on your PC, as well as adjust your extra BASS & EQ, as well as power options, and more stuff that I’m likely forgetting.As far as aesthetics, I love them. They are like stylized airplane pilot headphones, in a nice black paint.For build quality, I’m a bit mixed: they feel sturdy & solid, yet delicate, which I attribute to my appreciation of their aesthetic. Like, though they feel solid, I want to be careful with them. So that’s likely my bias.To sum it up:If you’re using these inside, or you don’t sweat much, and you get them at a lower price, or just like the way they look, definitely worth it.Otherwise, I think there are better options at the full retail price these go for, unless you like how they look.",
    "40": "So quality is pretty good, speaker puts out good sound and playing games is an enjoyable experience. Mic is ok/good.Would not buy again, here’s whyDoes NOT pair wirelessly with Xbox XIf you lose the wire you are screwed.. making the headset useless as OEM replacement wires are near impossible to come by from the manufacture website and any “replacement” wires that say it’s for the headset only allow audio but don’t allow you to talk so communication is impossible.So your only option is to buy another headset if you ever wish to talk to people.",
    "41": "its great quality, value of money, my son any head phone don't last for month, but they are fine until now",
    "42": "I bought these headphones as a wireless solution for gaming and listening to music in my room, as the corsair headset I had been using was both limiting in how far away from my PC I could get, as well as the fact that I kept tripping on the cord or getting it caught on my office chair as I'd roll it around.Set up:Set up for these headphones was easy and quick. I followed the included instructions, restarted my rig, and it was done. My only complaint here is that the included Razor software did cause some issues for some reason when it was running alongside Discord, so I've opted to not run it. Neither the headphones nor my Razor mouse have RGB, so it's not really a loss.Sound:After using these for a week, and running some tests on them the sound seems good. The range they can reproduce seems to be 30 to just a few points under15,000 Hz. There is some rumble or buzzing when the bass frequencies are quickly modulated, and it can at times get a little muddy. This is especially evident if you adjust the volume at the same time, but this really was only noticeable while I was actively testing the sound, and doesn't come up often when gaming or listening to music where there are many different tones at once. I suspect that only the utmost audiophiles would really mind. (Which I'm not.)Voice:Voice is hard to judge when using VOIP because so much also depends on what the other party is sending out, your latency with the Discord or other server, and lastly your own audio equipment. As such the most I can say is that the headset was no disappointing and performed at least as well as any other sub-$200 headset I've used. I don't expect you're going to have the binaural experience of your life, but I have no complaints.Microphone:Speaking with those in my gaming group, they report that the quality of the voice I was sending with my mic was clear and crisp, and that there was no appreciable background noise. All in all, I'd rate it better than the Corsair HS60 I had been using.Noise cancelation:Using these, I was unable to hear my wife.Comfort:I've had issues before with other headsets feeling tight, or putting pressure on the arms of my glasses, which can over time be painful. Thankfully, the ear cups on these headphones are much lighter is the pressure they apply, and as a result I get no pinching or discomfort. Everything is very soft, and the experience is pleasant.Fit and Finish:The headset looks really well put together, and although I've already left some fingerprints on the satin black finish, it is relatively simple to clean.",
    "43": "After using this headset for the last six months on various games, PC and consoles, I can give my honest review.Pros:- Great sound after messing with settings- Comfortable to wear (Have worn for 8+ hours and not gotten uncomfortable)- Sleek lookCons:- Poor mic performance for a headset of this price- Bulky if you have a smaller headBottom Line:If you're main focus is the sound quality, I think these are a solid choice. It has a good battery life and it's comfortable for long sessions. But if you plan on using it for communicating in games or calls, you're better off looking for something else.",
    "44": "The Razer Black shark V2 pro is the BEST wireless gaming headset I've EVER owned! I mainly play on PS4 pro & PC and the Black shark V2 pro works seamlessly with the PS4 pro console as well as the laptop. my wife has the Razer Nari essential wireless gaming headset and it's amazing! I decided to see what fit my needs best & that's when I decided to purchase the V2 pro.'setup'-  wireless setup is a breeze, it's essentially plug & play for both PS4 pro and PC. it also has 3.5mm jack in case it dies or you need to use it with a cell phone.'build quality'- the Black Shark V2 pro headset is built extremely well! the headband is strong yet flexible. the V2 pro doesn't have the typical \"leather\" ear cups as most other Razer Headsets do, instead it uses a \"Flowknit Memory Foam Ear Cushion.\" at first I was afraid they wouldn't seal around the ear & cancel noise as well leather cups do. I was wrong, the memory foam does well for \"noise cancelling\" as it creates a nice seal & best of ALL it stays Soo much cooler than leather cups which is a nice touch.'Microphone'- The 9.9mm detachable discord certified Razer Hyper clear Super Cardioid Mic provides excellent voice recreation! it's able to pick up your voice perfectly because it's aimed right at your mouth while at the same time suppressing noise coming from outside sources. haven't had a single complaint from my Warzone teammates lol.'Sound Quality'- the V2 pros sound Quality is something I've NEVER experience before on a headset! the 50mm Triforce Titanium Drivers manage to have amazingly deep BASS, crispy Mids & smooth Highs at the SAME time! the drivers have a patented, custom tuned design that allows perfect sound recreation of the audio frequencies! the amazing thing is that without changing any settings, straight out if the box they sound great. you can also customize the headset if you prefer deeper bass or a more rich treble with the synapse PC software.'Conclusion'- If you are in the market for a new gaming headset I highly recommend the Black Shark V2 pro! it's the BEST bang for your buck IMO as it offers superb audio quality along with numerous settings & features with synapse. it's also easy to use, plug & play wireless along with the optional 3.5mm wired connection if it happens to die mid game. battery life is phenomenal as I average anywhere from 20-24hrs depending on the volume. you'd be hard pressed to find another headset as good as this one. you will fall in love with the Black Shark V2 pro! happy gaming!",
    "45": "I bought this after my last headset broke, and I couldn't be happier! I was worried  about the sound quality of music and YouTube videos, but this headset's blown my expectations away! The batter life is amazing, and you'll never have an issue if you leave them charging overnight like I do! If you're thinking about buying this headset, go for it! From one nerd to another, you wont be disappointed!",
    "46": "very good high quality headphone",
    "47": "The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset has completely blown me away! The THX 7.1 Spatial Surround Sound experience is truly immersive, and the 50mm drivers deliver crystal clean music. I really like the detachable microphone, which makes switching between gaming and listening to music a breeze. The headset is quite pleasant to wear, even for extended periods of time. It's also backwards compatible with PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. I definitely recommend this headset to any serious gamer; it truly elevates your gaming experience!",
    "48": "Razer BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset: THX 7.1 ~150 USDThese earphones have beautiful sound and are very comfortable! There were no weird ear pains after extended use (for you hardcore gamers or audiophiles).  I spent the first night owning them just listening to my stereo receiver (Marantz system). Playing high quality, lossless audio files, was great. MP3 will not make these headsets shine due to their crappy quality. Elder Scrolls Online was amazing with this set. I could hear all sorts of ambient and directional sound I never noticed before and felt much more immersed. That is saying a lot because I have very nice computer and stereo already connected together it plays though.The Headset Setup - was both really easy and unclear at the same time. Once it was working and I understood its function it was been fine. I read the instructions and could not get the audio through to the set. Directly wiring them proved they could work and produce sound. Windows sound settings in my computer has 8 possible options listed. 'Speakers (Razer BlackShark V2 Pro)' was my 'wireless' setting. 'Speakers THX spatial' has never worked, I assume it is because I have not yet played THX film or THX certified audio yet. Wired, I saw it was 'Speakers (High Definition Audio Device)'. I have a lot of audio devices attached it seems weird they cant get 'wired' or 'wireless' or 'BlackShark' in to the listed options for clarity.Charging port - I think it is an old school usb mini port on the headset, for the price I expected something better. USB-C would have been nice, or a headset stand that charges. The port does not connect smoothly and can be inserted crooked easily. Fully inserted, it looks and feels halfway in, probably it  is just poor manufacturing that it does not snug up to the plastic body well.In my experience this is the headsets flaw, this charging port will be the failing point. Some dirt or dust or food piece gets in there or the tiny connector wires get worn or bent and it is all over for wireless. I have ruined handfuls of these ports in my past devices. I know the batteries will wear out in 3-5 years but I have sets that have lasted 15 years.I hope this helps someone out!",
    "49": "Great sounding and feeling headset all together. Big downside is these have an issue where you sound like you're under water, not sure if there are any fixes for it but the chance you get a pair that do this is a 50/50",
    "50": "So lets Start with the Pros:10-Band Graphical Equalizer in SynapseSuper Comfortable FitDetachable Boom MicRather Crisp Sound (ONCE ADJUSTED)Massive Battery LifeAble to use WiredThe Neutrals:BulkyEar Cup Controls kind of smallCons:No Noise CancellationSo-So Isolation.Included Carrying Bag is CheapThis headset is replacing a HyperX I was using. First thing I noticed was it felt much more premium and comfortable compared to my last. I think a nice fabric ear cup is superior for comfort, but that is kind of personal choice.  Another bit of personal choice is styling. These are VERY under-stated for a razer product, and with the detachable boom mic, they can be made a bit sleeker. The clamping isn't extreme, and they hug my head nicely. If you have a large head though, may not be enough wiggle room. The metal design of the hinge is really attractive because that's usually where my headsets fail.Sound Profile:So, with a bit of adjustment, these can sound PHENOMENAL for the price. Here's what you do-Turn off THX Spatial audio unless you're gonna be playing a game that uses it. Under enhancement, you want all the boosts, clarity, and normalization turned off. Set the EQ as follows, 0 0 -3 -3 1 0 3 -1 -4 8 as a baseline and adjust from there. For the \"Sound\" tab I would also set the volume between 70-74 so it doesn't crush out some highs.Doing all this makes the headset punch WAY above its weight.",
    "51": "Given the great reviews I was thrilled with the sale price I got these for. I'm also a huge fan of my Razer gaming mouse and keyboard, so what could go wrong getting a Razer headset?Unfortunately, this headset is an incredibly weak offering from Razer.The Microphone:The microphone isn't worth this price point at all. Yes, I know headset mics aren't usually super high quality, but this is super LOW quality. My voice was quiet, scratchy, and almost robotic sounding to my friends. When I logged on to Discord to talk to them the first time a friend I regularly game with said, \"Woah, what happened to your voice. That sounds awful.\" We tried to troubleshoot together with me toggling different options on Razer Synapse to see what might make it sound better, but nothing did. This headset has a serious mic problem and that alone is a disqualifier for any headset claiming to be a \"pro\" version.The \"mic monitor\" that allows you to hear your own voice in the headset didn't work. I've heard other say it's tied to the volume knob on the headset... which is insanely bad design.The Comfort:Here is one place the headset excels. I found it to be extraordinarily comfy, and this is the only reason I spent as much time trying to troubleshoot and see if my issues were a setting on my side.The Audio:Audio sounds fine. Other reviewers were correct in stating this is not great for music. It does sound good, but not great, for gaming. I would say for the price point the audio is fine (for gaming) but you can't use it for other activities and have it retain that same level of quality. Audio I streamed from the hifi streaming app Tidal sounded rough, and Youtube video audio sounded horribly compressed.Synapse:Razer's synapse driver has had no issue with my mouse and two different keyboards I've used with it. But this headset was a different story. Synapse would get stuck on a \"loading\" icon when trying to detect the headset. In order to get it to appear, I always had to completely restart Synapse to get it detected.Summary:In summary, this is absolutely not a pro level headset. I'm going back to my $50 Turtle Beach pair I've used for years. I bought this pro headset because I wanted to go wireless, but my cheap Turtle Beach headset has a microphone that puts this thing to shame and decent enough audio that it's not a huge step down from this unit. Which is not a great look for a headset that calls itself \"pro.\"",

Someone must of bought them tried them on and returned them. No marks, cracks, or blemishes of any kind. I love this product and I highly recommend them new or used. Razer makes quality products and are built to last.  I have had them for a few days and no complaints of any kind so far. If you decide to pick up a pair you will not be disappointed.",
    "59": "The headphones work, great, no complaints with the sound quality or the microphone. However, they become uncomfortable for long sessions.",
    "60": "Primary intended use was for PC gaming and multi-player coms during gaming.Initial setup was pretty easy.  I was surprised that the connections weren't USB-C, but instead were micro-USB.  A previous headset from razer that I have for the Xbox was USB-C.  It was, and still is Fantastic!  this one, not so much.The Synapse software seemed a little invasive.  However, when working properly, the surround was excellent.  I did have to adjust stuff quite a bit to get my friends to be able to hear me loudly enough.  There were many complaints of me not being loud enough.  It was adjustable, just had to rifle through the software and settings to max it out.Comfort:  Very comfortable, nice mic placement, comfy top pad and nice large ear pads.Controls: I LIKE the volume knob on the left ear.  Easy to find/adjust with a nice 'detent' for mid-volume level.  Other than a 'mute' button for the mic and a power button that's IT.  huh?  No controls for mixing chat/game?  No blue-tooth connection so I can be on my phone and game at the same time?  Pretty spartan for  $130 headset.  Incidentally, the other razer headset for xbox HAS those features.  A pretty rare case for me when something intended for the xbox surpasses a PC peripheral in features and capabilities.  I guess I'll name drop here because the other one is a fantastic headset.  It's a Razer Kaira Pro Wireless.  Great range, great functionality, great options, great connections, just not for the PC without different adapter.I guess it's my fault but I assumed a \"V2 PRO\" would come with bluetooth AND 2.4ghz, (Like the other razer/xbox headset I have).  NOPE.  This one is wireless yes, but it's beep-boop, beep-beep constant connecting and disconneting was terrible.  Also, being wireless usually means you can get up and grab something from the frindge, w/out losing contact but not this one.Not much else I can say about this one.  As I decided to start looking into getting another headset, someone here accidentally ran into the USB dongle, plugged into the top/front of my PC, breaking it.  I was unable to find a replacement USB adapter (Razer says they're sold out) so I've opted for an entirely different headset.Steel Series Arctis Nova 7.  Incredible so far.It's a little more expensive than this one but it works like I expect.  Great range, (I can go outside of my house) great sound, slightly smaller ear pads than the Blackshark but still comfy.  Anyway, sorry Razer, I've moved on.  :-)",
    "61": "Love these headphones my Is 2nd pair 1st one is still a work.. but I want to get the white ones hehehe  One thing I did notice though The mic on the 1st one is better than the  Second . Not sure why but I'll  give  it some  time to break in",
    "62": "Decent headphones all-around for gaming and music. The microphone isn't particularly great, but I've had worse. Nothing particularly wrong with these headphones, just nothing special either.",
    "63": "To start off the sound is great and if you don’t like it out the box you could fine tune it with their software . Also they’re wireless and use a dongle , I gotta say it works pretty well but i do have one gripe that ill get to later . One of the reason I switched to this headset was for comfort after coming from leather earmuffs and wired headset , It was just easier to justify using them since it was easier , more comfortable and less messy . the fit is really great too , not too tight but doesn’t feel like its gonna fall off and great build quality , the last headset i had was only a bit cheaper but felt like it was made up of melted down barbie dolls . So my only gripe is that I can’t walk across my room without hearing a beep which I think means its losing connection , Bit it’s probably because I have the dongle on the back of the PC so it looks cleaner  which is just my preference but something to think about . I have nothing else bad to say , this is a great headset all around and i highly recommend it.",
    "64": "Probably one of the best gaming headsets on the market.  Looked around online and they were rated 2022 best gaming headsets.  They are extremely comfortable on the head and ears for long period of use.  The features are simple and easy to use.  Friends were able to hear me clearly with the mic that was included.  Battery life was amazing for a wireless headset.  Doesn't really come with noise cancellation but the sound is loud, immersive, and bass cancels out any background noise.  Overall best headset I have purchased and will keep this till it no longer turns on.  Have a friend who put this product that plays in console and it was impressed.  Software installation was quick and easy on PC.",
    "65": "I assume this is an older model and that's why it's cheaper and not USB-C compliant?Other than the usb thing everything's great. Good sound quality, lightwight, and the mic is extremely good (that's 100% the main reason I got this).Bluetooth and usb-C definitely would have been nice to have on Razer's top-rated mic headset since I got this for work, but I guess we'll have to wait for them to put all of their best features into one headset.",
    "66": "I'm loving this headset. It has really good sound and the detachable mic is good for storage.",
    "67": "Sounds good, clear audio, comfortable, all around good headset.  Little to no bass, so that could be better. Volume adjustment is nice to have, wireless with a backup 3.5mm headphone jack is good for extra long gaming sessions.",
    "68": "Simplemente perfecto 👍",
    "69": "The blackshark headset is a very high quality product; extremely comfy and high quality. Before I had the wired one which works great with a ps4! But alas, my cat decided to snack on the wiring… (he is okay 😂) so I figured I would get the wireless one next. It is advertised that it works with ps4… but after speaking with Razer customer support (they do a phenomenal job) they told me that in order for the headset to work with a ps4 you need to purchase the Xbox One stereo adapter… which is a wire… lol. If you want a Razer headset to work for your ps4, go to the Razer website and find the Kaira Pro one. Amazon does not have this product sadly… they only have the one meant for Xbox One. It is $50 more but it also comes with a ps5 controller charging stand (in case you’re planning on getting a ps5 like me 😅). Hope this helps someone!",
    "70": "I cannot begin to express my appreciation for Razer and these headphones. I bought them recently because I have been working remotely as a contact tracer following COVID and because I make calls all day, I thought I would spend the extra money and get the gaming benefit from them as well. For that alone I would repurchase these as they have excelled for what I needed and wanted it for, plus the 3D sound is really really cool. BUT... that iss not the reason I am writing this review.I am writing this review because of my girlfriend, she is a night shift nurse at a local pediatric hospital in their oncology department. She works extremely hard and often does back to back to back 12 hour shifts. Sleeping during the day does not come naturally no matter how long you do nightshift, but it was made even harder just this morning when my apartment complex decided to do fire alarm testing starting at 9AM and still going as I write this 3 hours later. She called me crying, stating all she wanted to do was go to sleep, as I was barely able to discern what she was saying over the BLARING alarms. I rushed home from my workplace and started to do everything I could to mute the sound. I was duct taping towels over the alarm(probably illegal), had picked up Ear plugs from CVS on the way home, and tried to create a sound proof fort around the couch so that she could get a a couple of restful hours before returning to help the kiddos. ALL of this did nothing to blunt the sound. it was then it came to me.... the razer headphones! I quickly plugged in the USB wireless port, detached the mic and placed them around her head. I connected to spotify on my playstation and put on the most relaxing chill playlist I could and then pushed the button and turned on the headphones.... I looked at her, alarms still blaring in the room and she looked at me, wiped her eyes on my sweatshirt sleeve, and then laid down and fell asleep. For this moment alone I would have paid 10x what these headphones are priced at. Razer makes an exceptional product, whose comfort and ability to block out outside sound is able to console the hero that is currently sleeping on my couch. I will be forever thankful.",
    "71": "I originally bought this headset elsewhere but found the price to be cheaper on amazon! This is a great choice headset for gamers, I love that the mic is detachable in case anything happens I just need to replace the microphone. There are better ones out there but this one fit my price point.",
    "72": "I went through a couple PS5 headsets before settling with this great headset! I had the HyperX Stinger Core, Turtle Beach 600 Gen 2 and now this Blackshark V2 Pro and it’s definitely the best! It doesn’t have any fancy features or presets but it makes up for that with quality. The headset feels very sturdy, is very comfortable and the ear cups feel great, my friends say I have the best mic quality, and it sounds phenomenal! I use the Steel Series Arctis 7 on my PC and I genuinely think this Razer headset is slightly better because it’s lighter and longer battery. I had issues with static or audio cutting out on the first 2 headsets and this one has been crystal clear so far. Glad I bought it on sale and very happy. Razer has came a long way in the last few years and I think this is one of there best offerings at the moment.",
    "73": "I have used these a few times so far and feel like my opinion of them probably won't change much over time, pending some drastic change with them. I don't want to lie and say I don't like them, I ALMOST love them! There are just a few things that hold them back from being excellent.The sound with these is just okay. I wasn't expecting studio quality or anything, but I think the audio could be a little better. I don't know if it is because of the THX Spacial audio that I need to figure out how to disable or adjust, but sometimes they sound tinny. Call me old school, but just give me two channels: left and right.The battery life seems fine. I haven't allowed them to die, but I have used them over several days for a few hours each without concerns for battery life. I know I can access a rough battery indicator through the Razer software, but it would be nice to tap the power button and hear \"X percent battery remaining\" or something like that. Even the jankiest and cheap wireless headphones I've tried have this feature, but that's more nit-picky.Completely unnoticeable latency from my experience. I have tried so many wireless headsets that end up in the garbage because they're advertised as \"Gaming Headsets,\" but when you have 500ms latency, you might as well mute the game. The fact that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly and not get caught up in my headset cord is magical. I catch myself trying to move the phantom cable out of my way because I am so used to it. It's like when I wear contacts and keep trying to push my glasses up, but it's a good feeling.I say that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly because these have a horrid range. I am sitting 3 feet from my PC using these, and I keep getting the disconnect/reconnect tone from turning to look out the window or even tilting my head to the side. From what I've seen, these are supposed to work up to 10 meters. The advertised 10 meters must be in a vacuum because, in my real-life scenario, I'm getting roughly 1 meter. I think Razer may have forgotten the decimal in \"1.0 meter\". Even reaching up with my hand to turn the volume up or down blocks the signal and disconnects. This \"feature\" is excellent for when my wife talks to me, though, because I can just put my hand up and \"mute\" them!They are very comfortable. Some headphones I've used that are \"over the ear\" tend to be too small for actual over-the-ear coverage, or the headbands adjust in awkward ways that don't allow you to have a comfortable experience. The build quality is very excellent. They don't feel cheap and are put together well. I also love the removable microphone. So many gaming headsets have them built in and can't be removed.Pros:* Decent sound for gaming.* Good battery life.* Unnoticeable latency.* Very comfortable and adjustable.* Removable microphone.* Nice build quality.* Volume knob built into headphones.Cons:* THX Spacial audio seems lackluster.* Wireless range is terrible.Ultimately, they would be fantastic, but they are literally being held back by the awful wireless range. I am fine with the fact that I can't go check the mail and still be connected, but when I'm sitting directly in front of my PC and have disconnects, that's enough to make them not worth the cost. Fortunately, they support a 3.5mm cable so if you need more range than 3 feet you should be fine. Honestly, if I had a better wireless option I would probably send these back today.",
    "74": "Bought the wireless version of the V2s. For some reason, they're priced a very sizeable amount more then the wired versions which I believe had the same specs.Whatever the case, before a year of use, maybe around 9-10 months the headphones are already having issues with sound. Specifically, the left side audio is consistently softer and sometimes dies out completely before coming back a little while later.Been using them for a year now and still love them but the build quality just isn't there. Wireless is probably way overpriced too. Would love to buy them again though.Note: Originally I compared these with the Astro A50's. Personally, these sounded not only better but felt better. This was my experience. For the price point, definitely way more worth it if you're only a PC gamer and don't want to be using the feature of the A50's with Console <-> PC usage.",
    "75": "The best headset I've owned. Have zero complaints. Battery life, sound quality, comfort are all exceptional.",
    "76": "I was looking for a new headset mainly for gaming, along with other things. I've come from Turtle Beach's and most recently, a Razer Kraken. My main reason for switching was to experience the freedom that comes with being wireless. Being a Razer fanboy, I've stumbled upon the Blackshark V2 Pro (not to be confused with the Blackshark V2 X these negative reviews seem to mostly reflect.) After doing my research before I was about to spend almost $200 on these bad boys, I took to YouTube to see if any Tech YouTubers had anything good to say in an attempt to justify the price tag. Most of them were phenomenal, especially for gaming. So everything was telling me to place the order, which I did.I will say, they came out the box fully charged when I was expecting at least a half charge. Perfect condition, nothing better than unboxing new tech. After hooking them up, I wasn't surprised. These headphones scream quality. Everything from the seamless set up, to the surround sound, these headphones just checked off every box. They look pretty cool too. A lot had to say about how they sound with music and movies and what not and to be honest, I don't really care. I've had dollar store headphones, and I've had really, really expensive headphones. While the difference in sound for these is subtle, it's definitely there. However, I'm not an audiophile so I can't really pick out every sound not performing well. With the Synapse software, you can also adjust the sound and fine tune it to however you please so this issue in my eyes is irrelevant. Since I had a Razer Kraken, I definitely miss the cooling gel infused ear cups that came with it, versus these, they're more of a foam material, I believe to be memory foam? So you might find yourself getting a little warm in the ears. They're comfortable because they're lightweight but DO NOT feel cheap at all. They're also really comfortable with glasses.To recap, these headphones are a must buy for all Razer fanboys. It ties it all together to complete your cohesive Razer setup.  Being wireless, they definitely met my needs and surpassed the rest. HIGHLY recommend.",
    "77": "Ive been gaming since 1985. Ive owned a LOT of gaming headsets. The most recent was a SteelSeries Wireless Pro that retails for $350. This Razr blows it out of the water!In fact, this headset beats any Sony, Bose, Turtle Beach, SteelSeries, or anything else Ive ripped off and thrown at the wall because I just lost 50k souls to a random HallowI read a few trusted sources for reviews and was a bit in disbelief about their gushing over this headset, this isnt what Razer is known for. I have an MMO mouse from them for the launch of Diablo 3 back in 2011, THAT is what they are know for. I still use it to this day, no issuesNow…now they are known as the Lords of Boom!Being old, I didnt like that I had to download an app to get the full force of this headset (Synapse 3). But it basically runs itself, and you can modify any aspect of the 7.1 surround sound, even the points of contact and hz levels (goodbye campers!)In all seriousness, I have never been this blown away by a headset before. Razer is the one ring of sound. Get this while its still on sale!Its also comfortable AF!  (See that millennials?  Thats called adaptation!)👋.......🎤",
    "78": "U can’t plug in the wireless dongle into the the top usb, u have to plug it into ur CPU, it has really good battery life, quality could be better but the are comfortable.",
    "79": "I had been using the Corsair Void Pro for a long time, and decided it was time for an upgrade.  I tried many different headsets from many different companies, and they were either uncomfortable or had terrible sound.  Then I found the Razer BlackShark V2.  Although a simplistic design, the headset is extremely comfortable and has great sound.  I tried the THX Spatial sound app from Razer and it really didn't seem that great to me.  Instead, I got a DTS license and turned on DTS Headphone X spatial sound through windows and it sounds awesome!  The only negative about this headset is that it doesn't control the system sound like most headsets.  The volume dial turns the headset up and down separately from the system sound.  Not a huge deal, because once you figure out how to set the system volume, you can get the sound at the perfect level.  I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this headset.",
    "80": "Sounds is good and battery life is long. I play for hours so I can say they last for 3 days before you need to recharge. They are very comfortable light and feel good around your ears. I like how I can take the mic off so I can use my Hyper x Mic instead.",
    "81": "I do not recommend this product.Let's get a few things out of the way right away:- USB micro port for charging...-No Bluetooth! it requires a USB dongle or a headphone jack. So if you are looking for a solution that can work with multiple devices, this is not it. if you don't have enough USB ports on your laptop or PC, invest in a hub too.- not sure if I got a defective product or not but sound playback quality is ok at best if the volume is in the middle. As soon as you increase or decrease it towards its range you immediately start hearing static. I have seen $5 wired earbuds from alibaba do a better job at audio playback quality.- Battery life is less than 12 hours in best of conditions.- if your headset is on your head, it better be making noises or else it will turn itself off and you will miss that important meeting video call ring- you are forced to install the razor driver if you want to customize anything and the driver is poorly optimized.- There is a driver issue with the headset where it constantly pulls the  system interrupt for the LED and it slows down your PC specially if you want to use your USB bus for other things. I do a lot of games that require VR and hands on throttle and stick and I just had to unplug the headset all together or remove the driver. So I uninstalled the driver and now it works fine.- terrible microphone quality...(mine is still in the box, I did not even bother putting it on the headphone after testing it). My $25 webcam does a better job at recording audio! In a day and age where you can get studio quality mics for $40, this is just not acceptable.Now things I do like:- easy to access volume- removable microphone- the range is good! there is a good 20 feet range (with walls) before it disconnects- the headset pressure is just right. does not squeezy head at all and I manage to make it work with my glasses without having it hurt my earConclusion, there are some good features about this headsets. The mechanical (physical) parts are good. but it just does not worth the price tag! Again not sure if my product is defective but audio play and record quality is terrible for something you pay $150 for... I am very disappointed.",
    "82": "Prior to these headphones, I was using the Razer Nari Wireless headphones. The Nari's were good for a while, my only complaint was that the design was a little tacky, flimsy, and not the best quality. Plus the battery life wasn't the best. While using those, I realized I wanted a pair of headphones that were lighter in weight, lasted longer, wireless, and had a detachable mic. And the Blackshark hit all those checkmarks.In terms of weight, these feel phenomenal. They aren't too heavy, but not TOO light if that makes any sense. And the tightness on my head is perfect in my opinion. They aren't too tight where it is like it's suffocating the sides of my head, but it's tight enough to not fall off my head when twisting and moving my head. The quality on these headphones feel very nice as well. It's not a cheap plastic feeling, you can just tell that the build quality is quite high. Not to mention they look so simple yet clean as well.In terms of battery life, they last much longer than the Nari's. There is no RGB lighting on this headset whatsoever, so that allows the lifespan between charges to be much longer, hours longer. The charge time isn't that long as well. From dead, they will be at full battery within about 2-3 hours (non-use during charging). They typically last me a couple days between charges, with gaming sessions being about 6-7 hours each.And of course, this headset has a detachable mic, which is very handy for me because I use a separate usb microphone. But it does have on-board controls under the left ear cup. Power, a mic mute switch toggle, the mic port, a 3.5mm aux port for wired connection, and of course the charging port. I also like that this headset has a large dial for the volume, and only one dial at that. The Nari had two separate dials, one for simple volume control, and the other for game/chat mix balance. The BlackShark dial is a larger dial on the side of the left ear cup which simply just controls headset volume.I really like this headset, and see myself using it for as long as I can. I don't see myself searching for another pair of headphones after purchasing these. 10/10",
    "83": "I love these headphones there are amazing worth the money only thing I'm having a problem with is connecting to Bluetooth. I tried on my gaming laptop and my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus even my backup phone I use for wifi and I don't see it show up. I'm not sure what the name for it would be, I'm upset over that one thing, if it wasn't for these headphones having a optional wire to hook it up to your PC or phone jack I'd want a refund, but I just wish I could figure out why it's not showing up on Bluetooth. If anyone has the solution for this I would be very happy. But other than this one issue these headphones are amazing! Sound quality is superb! There's ordinary sound until you turn the knob which increases the volume 10 fold, the sound you get from using mic is amazing and it's very comfortable I could literally fall asleep wearing these listening to music and my ears wouldn't be feeling uncomfortable or nothing. Overall I'd rate this 4 stars due to the Bluetooth issue I'm having if it wasn't for that I'd give 5 stars.",
    "84": "Well put together, good quality and easily cleanable",
    "85": "Works perfectly",
    "86": "Its okay",
    "87": "Pros:-the design around the ears leaves some space in the area so the headset doesnt put pressure on your ears.-microphone quality is good (whenever it decides to work that is)-the battery life is really greatCons:-they are bulky and compress alot so after some hours still bother even though they dont pressure the ears.-the sound quality I found no much difference to my samsung bud + and totally subpar noice cancellation compared to them-oh dear, it has no bluetooth, you use a dongle for PC and console, to use it on the phone you need to use the phone jack cable, which is totally annoying. Even more so switching between the system is exaushting and sometimes flat out doesnt even work. I have to go through so much hoops for what exactly? The bud + already are lighter and switch so seamisly system to system.-the microphone, the only redeeming feature, I had lots of troubles getting it to work, and they simply do not work with discord with the phone jack. At least I got them to work with my work laptop/webex sometime ago (becuase the microphone refused to work with webex) so they are being used soley for work meetings right now.-probably if I ever got the software to work the sound would be better but I tried to use it and didnt understand at all how to get it running. I mean if I have to get out of my way to get something running from the get go we are already starting wrong no?In general, i dont know why would someone get this over the portablity, practicality, better sound and noice cancelation and system integration of any of the bud/air products honeslty",
    "88": "The mic sounds horrible straight out of the box. I HIGHLY suggest going into razer cortex and turning the mic volume up, as well as turning voice normalization on.Love the wireless capability with its relatively long battery life, however I do wish the microphone would have a greater pick up range. If the microphone isn't at least 2 inches away from my mouth it struggles to pickup my voice while talking normal-quietly.Another thing to note is the sound quality not being as great as wired headphones. I'm coming from a wired Logitech G Pro Headset and the quality is about 70% of what those are.Audio lag is not a largely apparent issue, but do keep in mind there is still some lag, for those that play games like CS:GO or Valorant, where sound detection and speed matter.Got these on discount for around $60 and for the price I would definitely buy again. If I were paying MSRP I would do research and find a better headset.",
    "89": "100% love this product. Totally worth the bait n switch price hike amazon did to me. They are amazing.  I have and will again recommend this headset to everyone.  One thing of note, its only wireless on a PC and if u use ur phone device or controller then it will have to be wired.",
    "90": "VERY comfortable, but mine came defective. I am returning it and ordering a logitech because I see that there are less issues with those. Other than that, the build quality feels great.",
    "91": "I have a big head.  I need big headphones.  Done.",
    "92": "First of all, the surround sound on these headphones are incredible. Immediately I gained a boost in FPS games because it became easy to locate enemies by noise alone. No more people running up behind me!However sound quality is meh. For gaming they are perfectly fine, however if you plan to listen to music as well there is some distortion. It really struggles with low frequencies and you get some really noticable distortion in bassy songs.As far as the build quality it's pretty sturdy. It also has a nifty volume wheel built into the left side, and the removable mic is nice. I can't comment on the mic itself because I don't use it. wqAnother annoying I have is the charging port. It uses micro USB, which is relatively fragile and also difficult to plug in sometimes. It works, but it'd be nice to see it with USB-C instead. I'd like to see that in a future version.Overall it's a good set of headphones but I wouldn't recommend buying them at MSRP. I got them on sale for $130 which is a fair deal I think.",
    "93": "Pros:Amazing surround soundGood premade sound profiles to choose fromComfortable fit for plus sized headSleek and clean lookCons:The softwareI really like this headset and it is a great step up from the old logitech pair that I have had since 2016. The sound is great for gaming as well as things like video and music. I really like that you have sound profiles to choose from in the software that make everything sound better when on the correct profile. This is where the headsets main drawback is, however.The software is a NIGHTMARE to deal with. I have several other razer products that I manage using Synapse 3 and for the most part, it hasn't been a drawback. However, with this headset, it can't seem to work. It's a luck of the draw if, when I boot up my PC, the headset will even show up in the software. I thought I had figured out a solution where I simply had to disconnect and reconnect the dongle. However, it always had to be reconnected to a different USB port to do a \"setup.\" I have now exhausted all of the USB ports on my PC and it is no longer a solution.Without being able to detect the headset in the software, you cannot change the sound profiles that make this headset amazing. It claims to be able to adjust automatically based on the application you are using but if you are like me and run multiple applications at a one time (Spotify in the background while playing a game) it cannot accurately decide which to prioritize. The sound quality is still good but knowing it can be great and not being able to utilize it is frustrating. I have tried repairing the Synapse 3 software and even uninstalling and reinstalling it but so far, I have had no luck.Summary: great headset, lackluster software. Would love to give these a great but until they can fix this software detection issue, they are only above average.",
    "94": "I've bought headsets for 20 years and it's great that sound tech keeps improving. The jump on this Blackshark V2 Wireless has been especially huge. Sometimes I confuse the sounds I hear on the headset with what's going on around me in my house. I also have a relatively large head and this headset is still comfortable as it's adjustable over a wide range. Lastly, the wireless feature makes a huge difference as I can wear it when doing chores or working out around the house. Highly recommended.",
    "95": "Overall, this is a great headset. I bought it for gaming on Xbox Series X with a secondary use-case as a work headset. I've tried dozens of headsets over the years trying to find something that works for both uses, including Bose QC 35, Bowers & Wilkins PX7, Astro AC50, etc.By far these are the most comfortable for long-term wear. I have a big head, so comfort is pretty much always an issue, but after wearing these all day for work I didn't experience any soreness at all.The soundstage is pretty impressive on these and it does feel really immersive. I've gotten compliments on the quality of my audio coming through the mic as well. They don't have ANC, but the passive noise cancelling is really really good.The only flaw unfortunately is kind of a big one, and that is the Synapse 3 software Razer offers to configure the headphones is only available on PC. My only computer is a Mac at the moment (that's what they give us at work), which means I can't take advantage of inline mic monitoring or adjust any of the other settings. This doesn't only apply to the Blackshark headphones - this applies to any Razer peripherals like keyboards, mice, etc. Seems like a HUGE miss to exclude Mac users from taking advantage of one of the major benefits of the product, especially when Synapse 2 was available for Mac. Looking at their support forums, it doesn't appear that this is likely to change any time soon.I will probably keep them as even with the stock configuration they're still pretty damn good, but wanted to make sure I wrote this review for other people considering these since this issue isn't very apparent in the product listing or documentation.",
    "96": "If you are wondering if it’s good on PS5 you’ve come to the right review. These headphones were directly compared to pulse 3D and turtle beach stealth 600.First of all these sound good. They have a full thick sound signature that has lots of body. These can be EQ’d when using them with a pc but for PS5 they can’t . This is ok however as they have great out of the box performance. The microphone is good and sounds better than the pulse and turtle beach. The headphones themselves sound way better than the pulse and turtle beach. The pulse were anemic sounding in comparison. There isn’t any deep bass on the pulse. There is plenty of deep bass on the Razer. The bass is also better than the turtle beach.The turtle beach also suffer from poor connectivity. Probably the most aggravating issue with those headphones. These Razers connect instantly and maintain a very stable connection. The pulse also remain connected and connect instantly. The one major plus with the Sony pulse is that they are fully integrated into the ps5 which includes onscreen volume control and when you turn off the headset the sound automatically returns to the external speakers. With the Razers and turtle beach you have to manually toggle the audio out in the PS5 menu. Not a big deal but worth mentioning. I have seen other reviews stating that the Razer isn’t loud enough with PS5 and I just can’t figure out how anybody could want a headset any louder than these. The turtle beach was also about the same  perceivable loudness to my ears. The Sony slightly lower in volume but still loud to my ears. Out of the three the Razers have the best all around sound. The headset is also extremely comfortable where the Sony’s are horribly uncomfortable and the turtle beach are pretty goofy too as the ear cups have a wonky shape to them.The build quality is also better on the Razer.Out of the three the Razer is best for me. They have a nice full bodied sound signature and get loud enough for any fool.",
    "97": "I love these headphones right out of the box. Fairly simple set up given whether or not you already have the Razer Synapse software currently installed or not. If not it'll only take a couple of minutes to do. The sound quality is pretty exceptional given its a wireless headset. Doing alittle bit of tweaking with the sound profiles and it will fit your liking quite well. Biggest issue is that these headphones are incredibly dependent on the location that you place the USB receiver at on your computer. I currently have my router right next to my computer in my room and I notice that there is a notable 'audio static' that comes possibly from some type of receiver interference (read multiple different reviews stating the same issue when the dongle is in the same room as the router). Problem isn't necessarily a deal breaker but would be annoying if they were being used solely for their noise cancellation properties. My initial installation of the dongle did have its issues since another known issue with this headset being that if the dongle is placed on the back side of the computer it runs a fairly high risk of having continuous dropping of connection which if you play any type of game that is VERY reliant on sound this could get you killed and leave you angry from your session. Only after moving the dongle to the front side of my computer via a usb hub I was able to rid myself of the disconnection issue. I haven't had much of a chance to mess around with the spatial audio settings but from what I did use it seems to be well tuned. Overall would recommend them a try but be sure to note your issues and make sure your return window is still available just in case.",
    "98": "IiiiMy son purchased this with money he saved and he really enjoys them, he says they are great.Perfect for gaming of course and great to talk to others while gaming, I don’t normally spend this much on headphones but it seems like a really good investment.My son also watches movies in bed off with these being wireless, and is also able to listen to music and not drive me crazy!! I do wish for the price it came with a stand but other wise I am happy!",
    "99": "I use these for gaming and working from home so they get about 12-14 hours of use at least 5 days a weekI did some research on wireless headsets and settled on the Blackshark V2 Pros as the best choice. I am thrilled with them.The sound quality is amazing. The THX spacial surround performs amazing. A truly immersive gaming experience and great music performance. The razer synapse software has a good EQ as well as decent presets. You can fine tune the 7.1 surround and with a little tweaking it's like wearing a home theater set on your head.Speaking of wearing, the headset is light and headband is comfortableI don't have a large head but I found these to clamp a little hard especially as a glasses wearer. I place them on pc tower overnight and that seemed to loosen them up a bit and they are comfortable. This is really my only gripe.The mic quality is fine and what you would expect for a microphone of this type.The buttons are easy to use and find, however I wish the mute button was on the other side of the headset to avoid the \"pop\" when you unmute and mute the mic.Fantastic 24hr battery life means I can go 2 full work/gaming days without needing a charge and they charge surprisingly quick.Really can't say enough about these cans.",
    "100": "Before these I was using $7 earbuds.GOOD:So, yes they sound better. I can hear things in games (and music) I never heard with those $7 buds.Isolate better. I can't hear others talking or fan noise, etc.Are louder.Software highly customizable.24 hour battery. Rechargeable.Works well with Windows 10 dictation.They are comfortable on my pumpkin head and Dumbo ears.Highly reviewed online. There are better headsets, but way more expensive.2.4Ghz is better than Bluetooth. No lag time.Can remove mic from headset.BAD:But, overnight, cat takes and hides mic.Have to now hide mic from cat. Making it less convenient for me to use.Hotter feeling on ears.Summation. IMO and I researched for months. You can't find a better headset for the price.",
    "101": "I bought this back with my PC and they were pretty great the first time I bought them, however the microphone quality really isn't the best compared to other razer products, I don't understand why, may be some setting possibly. Another issue I have is the range and disconnection issues of these headphones, as sometimes I'm so close to my PC I shouldn't have it disconnecting constantly and beeping in my ear that it's disconnecting, but it does so anyways. The range isn't the best and you might as well go for some HyperX products if you're moving away from your PC often while wearing the headphones.",
    "102": "One of my favorite headsets i’ve ever bought!",
    "103": "9/10Overall, I LOVE the product. I am usually a stickler for a Hard Wired connection to reduce latency as I am a gamer but, this did not let me down in the slightest. My biggest letdown was the earcups, specifically their noise cancellation ability. I came from leatherette earcups with a solid back for ridiculously noise cancelling and great audio quality (Astro A40's) and I know these are different and I do love them but, I miss that closed-back, REALLY noise cancelling. If you're wanting a wireless product that's affordable and has a removable microphone. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend! I had been looking for headsets for years with a removable mic, why I originally went with Astro and just recently they seem to be getting that most gamers go with an external microphone and are allowing the flexibility with a removable one!",
    "104": "Seeing that everything else I own is a Razer product, I felt pretty confident making this purchase. While this headset sounds great and the battery lasts FOREVER, this product fell just short of being great. For such a steep price point, I was expecting this headset to deliver on all fronts. Unfortunately, I realized very quickly that the microphone on this headset is just bad. All of my friends that I game with joke about how it sounds like I'm a truck driver talking through a CB radio. This is not a deal breaker for this product but to be honest, I think this headset is worth closer to $100. The fact that it is so much more than the wired version of the headset is a little ridiculous, especially given the fact that EVERYTHING is wireless now.....that technology does not cost that much extra. I think this is a decent product with a large name behind it, and that's what you're paying for....the name. The other thing that makes me believe these are overpriced is the fact that you can't use these with your phone or any other device that doesn't have a USB input. For about the same price, you can get a regular pair of Bluetooth headphones that will connect to everything. For this reason, I felt some buyer's remorse after purchasing these. You make the call but if I could go back I would have gotten regular Bluetooth over the ear headphones.",
    "105": "I gave the Razer Blackshark V2 headset a shot recently, and I wasn't a huge fan of my experience.The Positives:This headset is definitely comfortable. I've tried multiple wireless headsets out recently, and this one was my favorite comfort-wise.The connection distance was also good enough for my small house. I could travel to the other side of the house and not lose connection, which is near the top of why someone would want to purchase a wireless headset.I loved the color options. It's hard finding a white headset out there than hasn't been marked up unfairly higher than darker headsets. I have a white PC build, and these fit my setup perfectly.The Negatives:I didn't like the sound in these. They felt very drown out by the bass, and the bass didn't feel very clean either. Everything was muddled together into a mess of an audio experience. I tinkered with the EQ settings to try and improve this, but nothing seemed to take away from the bad quality. Not enough clarity in these for me to be excited putting them on each time I'm at my computer.The build quality is ok, but adjusting the earcups felt like a nerve-racking experience. Like I was going to bend one of the side wires. This might just be an issue with me, but that whole setup just didn't feel very sturdy.The Sidetone, while being a feature in the Razer software, essentially didn't exist. Sidetone is one of the more important headset features for me, and this might've been the worst I've experienced. It is ever so slight, and the only way you'll notice it is if you're not listening to any other sounds. If you're in the heat of a game or listening to some music, you won't notice the Sidetone at all. I felt myself yelling at times when I didn't need to because I couldn't hear my own voice.The mic, while fully functional, just was average. I had some friends tell me that it sounds like they're on a phone call with me, meaning it wasn't the clearest sounding mic to them. They said that in comparison to the Logitech G Pro wired headset, it was night and day (even though that's unfairly comparing wireless to wired). In a more fair comparison, they said it was the worst quality between the BlackShark V2, Corsair HS80, and Corsair Virtuoso XT. Some may not care about this, but I want my mic to sound good to my buddies when we're gaming. Would also be nice to have something more clear when I need to do video meetings and whatnot.Overall, there were more negatives than positives with this headset, leading to me returning it. I know a lot of people say that there is no \"good\" wireless headset out there, but I've still set out to try and find something worthwhile. Unfortunately the BlackShark V2 wasn't the answer I was looking for.",
    "106": "I am very pleased with this purchase.  That says a lot, as I hate wearing headsets and in-ear 'buds' as well.  Just hate them.  The in-ear stuff never fits well, hurts or falls out.  The on-ear headsets tend to make my ear lobes sore, give me headaches.  The around-ear headsets tend to be too heavy and press too hard on the sides of my head.  Having been plagued with ear infections/strep my whole life, I am maybe overly sensitive to the things that make my ears uncomfortable.  That being said, these headphones are the most comfortable I have ever worn.  All the high tech and great sound mean nothing if you don't want to wear them or just can't.  That they are wireless is the icing on the cake.  Sound quality is just great.  I use it for work, wearing it all day taking/making calls via Jabber and the ubiquitous ZOOM meetings.  After work, I game with them and the sound is just great.  Voices/TV in the next room are muted to where it doesn't bother me when I am working and I sure can't here them when I am gaming.  I wear them the whole work day and they still have plenty of power and my ears don't hurt.  Best thing, they don't look like a Transformer, I can't stand stuff marketed for kids, this is a good design for USE.  Nice clean and simple design.  I used their software to turn off the power save feature so that they don't go to sleep while I am working and the charge still lasts all day.  So worth what I paid for them, best headset I have ever had.",
    "107": "Best headphones for my use.Wearing these headphones, it does not feel hot, unlike the pleather/leather ones. The earcups are made of fabric and are soft on the ears/head. The mic works great, no complaints when gaming with friends or even on the zoom/teams call for work scenario. Not gamery for zoom call. The mic is detachable. And the best part is that this is wireless. Connectivity is very simple and fast. No fuss with setting to connect. It uses a USB adapter to connect to the PC. Only downside is that is micro usb for charging. The battery however does last for weeks, charging on occassion but will last long game sessions.",
    "108": "Muy buen sonido, materiales de calidad, muy recomendable",
    "109": "Bought this to replace another set that broke. These work very nice to play online games or attend Zoom video meetings where you need to control what is heard on the other end and on your end ie Work",
    "110": "After using this for over a week, your ears will feel like they have been pushing up against a wall. The cups are not very deep and you will constantly rub against the back.You can buy a after market cups to solve this problem and that’s why I am giving them a lower star. The aftermarket ones I got is a bigger cup with a cooling gel so makes it more comfortable and I don’t rub against the back. I have very tiny ears and was shocked that I managed to have this problem.For gaming they sound good. Look around for EQ settings to make it even better.Noise canceling is soso with the standard earcups and better with aftermarket gel ones.Sound quality is good and nothing to complain about. For gaming and working from home it will do more than fine.",
    "111": "Wow. Razer sucks. And their quality sucks. I got these as a gift. I opened the box and immediatly noticed crackling both when I touched the volume knob AND at random parts of the audio being played. I figured no problem, its under warranty and I already registered the product with a picture of the order AND uploaded gift receipt. What followed was 2 months of going back and forth with their department.Apparently, the receipt I gave was not the \"correct receipt\" they wanted an order slip. I tried following their directions, sent the slip, and THAT was not right. I then spent weeks trying to get in my elderly parents account, followed their directions AND THAT receipt was not correct. Reuploaded. Rejected again.They then told me to contact Amazon. I did. I got the correct receipt from Amazon, waited for their response and was told I have the option to do \"Advanced return\" where I pay full price price again, or send in the item first. I at first wanted to do standard return, then a few days later got a response that they recomend doing the advanced return do to availabilty. So I said ok I'll do that. Then I get ANOTHER email, saying that first I have to send an email to them saying I \"acknowledge\" the advanced return. I responded \"acknowledged\" then waited. Waited days, got a response after that saying \"sorry, this was purchased from Amazon Warehouse, go through them. EXCEPT YOUR PRE-RETURN PROCESS TOOK 2 MONTHS! So that is not an option any longer!!! Plus I spent countless hours on the phone with them, on tech chat and showed multiple people the reciept and where it was purchased. They waited 2 months, ran me through all this, told me I they were going to exchange it, only for them to take their sweet time, and tell me they WON'T exchange it. I literally exchanged a $2000 3090ti EASIER AND FASTER, then I could return a pair of headphones from Razer.These headphones CLEARLY had an issue but they sold it anyway. They ask a premium $200 for it, but they provide a 3rd rate service when there is an issue.Plus, the wireless distance on these are a joke. Compared to other brands that offer tons of features and certified audio quality, these don't come close. I was fooled by good reviews here, and on YouTube. The wireless is crap. I have a one bedroom apartment and I can't walk into the kitchen without disconnecting. They also constantly cut out, orndisconnect, unless you plug them in directly, which defeats the purpose of the wireless in the first place!People love Razer, until they have a problem with their products. Then its an uphill battle of jumping through flaming hoops of fire, and they deny you anyway.Meanwhile, my $50 mouse return from RED DRAGON, was done in 2 emails, and they answered issues I had with a keyboard, and got me a new product in less 2 than weeks.STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!You are terrible Razer!",
    "112": "I was really disappointed with these because my previous headphones starting cutting out when I stepped 10 feet from my computer and I thought these would be better, at least since they were new. Unfortunately it's just as bad. Sometimes they cut in and out even when I'm sitting at my desk.",
    "113": "Good product all aroundMic works loud and clear according to the people that I play withSounds quality makes me feel like I'm in the game. Can even hear a mouse fart when it runs by lol jkFor real tho great headset :-)",
    "114": "Again, i tried logitech and hyperX headsets and then tried the razer blackshark v2's. Seriously these are super good quality, comfy and great everything.  One thing is, they are definitely noise canceling and are kinda heavy on your ears, but i think i just need to get used to it.5 month review on these. Qaulity of the jell/foam around the ears still amazing! Best 119$ i spent on any PC accessory. Sound quality amazing, mic is clear it's not the most bass or like a standing mic quality but it's also a 119 not a 500$ mic.  Overall 10/10 would buy again. The comfort around your ears is amazing and the battery life is good as long as you don't charge it every single day it'll last long and it does for me almost half a year after my purchase.",
    "115": "I've had my pair for almost a year now and it has been one of the best purchases I've made in the sense of gaming. I don't use the microphone but as headphones, they are beyond great. Games are clear and bassy as well as music and videos. I play game like Overwatch and Valorant where audio cues and footsteps can be important and these do a great job at picking them up. The charge is great and the pairing is easy, I charge my headphones about 1-2 times a week with the included micro usb cable and it usually takes about 2-3 hours to go from red to full battery. There is an included adapter you just put in a usb port on your computer and whenever you power on the headphones, they are ready to go!",
    "116": "Really good headphones!Im happy with my purchase HOWEVER,These aren’t fully supported for ps5!  but sound is amazing,My favorite things on this are:1-the comfort on this headset is no joke! Super comfortable, my gaming sessions are  normally5-6hrs and with the original ps5 headset within 2 hrs of playtime my ears started to hurt!the V2 are that comfortable that feels that they are not even on your head.2-noise cancelling its superb, cant hear a thing from outside and will not disturb your session.3-sound wise, the headset provides really clean and precise sorround sound. while playing COD, i can really heard a lot of the details from the map and definitely can hear where the adversaries are because of the direction of the steps coming from.I have to say, the headset are a bit of the high end frequencies and really good bass to it.The only CONs that i can think of are these:Theres no way to control im game chat volumes. Which is a bummer. There’s been times that i cant hear my teammates cause is only one volume knob.And sadly these arent MAC supported. So i dont have acces to their full potential and settings.Not biggy but since im on a ios-mac cant use them in other things.Overall they are really good headphones. A bit steep on the price. But they are doing the job just fine. They are gonna get me by for now until there’s a fully supported ps5 headset.",
    "117": "I had a pair of Astro headphones that operate on the 5GHz wireless frequency. Great sounding headphones, and comfortable, however when I walk to my kitchen I get dropout because of the electronics (fridge, microwave, etc). This is not supposed to happen on headphones that operate on the 2.4GHz frequency. It didnt happen on the Logitech that I had before the Astro, but it was super uncomfortable.So... to the Razer review--- The product states that you can go \"up to 12m away\" from the USB transceiver. for us not on metrics, that is about 39 feet. I get about 15-20 feet away from my computer in my small house and the signal starts dropping out. Every time it starts dropping out it starts beeping at me in my ears which is really annoying on top of the fact that I cant hear the people that are talking! The point of having wireless headphones is so that you can move away from your computer while gaming, maybe to the restroom, maybe to grab something to eat/drink, maybe to answer the door and not miss anything that is going on.I  have no idea about the Noise cancellation, I used these for two and a half 4hr D&D sessions before I went back to my Astro headphones. Sound was alright, the headphones are pretty tight against my head, which is what I disliked about the Logitech ones I had. I was hoping Razer would be better, I have Kraken at work and they are amazing, however the most I am using them is for a zoom for maybe and hour, so I do not need to have wireless headphones at work. At home I need to have them. Hopefully the next pair will be better.",
    "118": "I have the steal series 7, but they are very heavy and they gave me a headache, I bought these because they are more comfortable, and without a doubt they are, very comfortable that they don't even feel, the perfect sound, I have no complaints. clearly each one has their own, the razer does not have an led when the microphone is muted. but it is only a small limitation compared to all the benefits offered by the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro, they are the best.",
    "119": "My kraken v2 7.1 started going out after a few years with them so I replaced it with the Corsair virtuoso and that was a huge mistake.. The most uncomfortable headset I’ve ever used. So I researched it up more “which I should of done in the first place” and kept seeing great reviews about the blackshark v2 pros. So i went and bought them. First pair I received and a nasty rattle sound on the right ear cup so I did an exchange through amazon and the second pair were way better. But the ear cups were also on the small side like the Corsair virtuoso so I looked into after market stuff for the head set and only one company on YouTube I found that actually had something. The company name is “misodiko”  and I ordered the ear cup replacement and with the 8 days I got them and swapped them out and yes! Muuuch better with the replacement ear cups hands down! Plush and thick and so much better than the oem ones. Got them on sale for 16 bucks so anyone thinking of getting these it’s honestly a must have right from the start. You will laugh on how bad the oem ones are even a few youtubers complain about the material razer used on these. But other than that I also did use a quick connect magnetic charging method because I’ve had bad luck with micro usb. Why razer used micro and not usb type-c is questionable but with the quick connect i won’t have to worry about it breaking on me now. Over all very happy with these. Sound is great the fake 7.1 is the best I’ve heard out of a head set. Just change the ear cups out right away if you get these and you will be set."
