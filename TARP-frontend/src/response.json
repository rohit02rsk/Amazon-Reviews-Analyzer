    "1": "Bought this set primarily for the keyboard to use at work.  LOVE the fact the keys are SILENT when typing.  If you like a keyboard that makes a loud clicky clacky, this is NOT the keyboard for you.  Keys are smooth, medium height and show color pretty well.Really happy with this set.",
    "2": "Product is awesome. Works fantastically. No issues at all, and functions as it's supposed to. My only complaint is how it was shipped. It was sent via USPS and not through Amazon itself, which caused a lot of problems. First, the package was way too big to fit inside a mailbox (obviously) but it also could not fit inside a parcel mailbox either, and I was forced to retrieve it from the post office. Items like this are better sent via Amazon's own delivery service, or Fedex, etc. USPS is not designed to deliver large packages. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.",
    "3": "Great product with a great price. Bought these for the kids computers and they haven't had any complaints with it. Good rgb color schemes.",
    "4": "the keyboard is actually decent but the mouse sensor is pretty dog water even for regular use.. i dont know if its cuz i dont have a mousepad but the mouse isn't great.edit: ok it turns out you need to put in the weights and get a book of a certain texture or a mousepad to make the sensor perform better.",
    "5": "This is a great set for the money. You can't control the lights but it is a great keyboard regardless. The mouse is very smooth in regards to movement. It's not overly fancy but it gets the job done!",
    "6": "I'm not a gamer, so I can't attest to the gaming functionality of this board. But otherwise, it fills my hoem computing needs perfect. Nice keystrokes. Mouse fits me perfectly. No complaints!",
    "7": "Great RGB keyboard for the price. My son loves it. Only reason for the loss of a star is that the mouse isn't RGB and only lights up red, this is slightly aggravating to him but all in all you can't go wrong for the price",
    "8": "just got it. time will tell. got it super quick and the price was very good.",
    "9": "I bought this for my son to play games and he loves it. It\u2019s also affordable and comes with the mouse, which is decent too.",
    "10": "Updated after enough use to adequately review 12/10/22:The keys are a tad bit too small. The mouse after one day - right mouse button sticks. I use it to toggle zoom so I don't press and hold it I just tap it. The left button does have a satisfying click and the resolution of the mouse improved gaming performance by an order of magnitude.Interesting but true - see picture - this keyboard has two R keys. The left R key is actually the E key.I can touch type on the keyboard but it takes some getting used to because of the small size of the keys and the smaller than usual spacing. I will live with it for a while but I should have bought a mechanical keyboard.This will definitely improve your gaming performance if you are currently using any form of wireless mouse. I was using Logitech M510 wireless gaming mouse and a Logitech ergonomic keyboard and they both experienced latency and connection issues.Overall very satisfied.",
    "11": "My GrandSon Loves the keyboard.",
    "12": "My son uses this setup for his PC games.  he loves it.",
    "13": "The keys sound good the mouse is actually bigger than expected and clicks smoothly. Love the lights and dont have any problems with it.",
    "14": "You get what you pay for. Mouse dpi seems slow though. Couldn't adjust or it would have been 5 stars.",
    "15": "I have definitely enjoyed my purchase of the keyboard. It has exceeded all expectations. The mouse is awesome.",
    "16": "I like the keyboard and the mouse.  Probably more the mouse as it is just the colors I wanted the keyboard would be better if you could eliminate colors you don't want.  The different patterns are nice though.",
    "17": "I like the different lighting functions, but honestly I don\u2019t mess with the different functions too much. The mouse is smooth and fits nicely in my hand. The mouse goes on sporadically even when the computer is off, maybe I\u2019m doing something wrong but I usually just unplug and plug back in. The keys on the keyboard are comfortable. Good set up.",
    "18": "This keyboard is smooth and easy to use. Colors are pretty bright. Easy to game with!",
    "19": "Kind of soft / quiet keys, yet appears tough. No complains.",
    "20": "Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the \"you get what you pay for\" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange \"tall\" type that relocates the \"\\\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. \"#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?\" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... \"What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return\". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.",
    "21": "Estoy satisfecha con la compra, se puede modificar f\u00e1cil la intensidad y color de las teclas hasta el momento ha funcionado muy bien, tanto el teclado, como el mouse. Puedo digitar a buena velocidad sin ghosting.",
    "22": "Good",
    "23": ", it doesn't feel like a mechanic keyboard but it is,  for the price is the best you can buy",
    "24": "This was a very good deal. I got it expecting it to last around 6 months before breaking. I was extremely surprised. So far it is the same as on day one. The keys are a little loud, but I don't mind that. The keys have a good feal to them. Also, the lights are very good quality and are easily customized. Just a simple FN and Insert, Home, Page up, Delete, End < or page down button and you have change in lights. You don't have to download some sketchy website to change the colors. The mouse is good and works well. Gives off and receives light well. It is a really great deal that will last you a long time. It works for both gaming, work, and school use. Very smooth. Also, it is easy to change mouse speed. Just one click of a button and you are done. Once again, I am extremely pleased with this product and would defiantly buy it again.",
    "25": "Works as intended, good price",
    "26": "Looks better than expectedWorks as promised",
    "27": "This is a great starter keyboard for anyone cool lights that change patterns.",
    "28": "I needed a keyboard with Numpad but also like occasional gaming. This one looked decent and works fine for intended use. Unfortunately the colored lights reset daily and have to be reset to a preferred single color (unless you like flashing rainbow colors) and it is not a quiet keyboard at all.  It again, for the price it works!",
    "29": "This keyboard is comfortable to use and looks nice. Nice addition to a gaming setup.",
    "30": "This is a great keyboard. My Logitech stopped working after a few years, and I needed a replacement.  I figured I would get the same one but when I looked it up it was 120 dollars that I didn't have.  I saw this one had great reviews and for under 40 dollars I decided to give it a shot.  I spent a lot of time using the computer, and I game a LOT.  It's not clicky, but I can still feel the press of each key when I'm using it.  I love the low profile buttons.  The lighting is beautiful, I rotate through a few of the different colors and lighting effects.  My favorites are the pastel rainbow, and the mode that slowly fades through each color on a rotation. My one and only complaint would be that the finish on the keys is wearing off.  I've only had this for two months now, and as you can see by my picture, the paint on the WASD and space bar is wearing off in places.  The corners of the 2 and 3 buttons are also wearing off as my nail hits against it when I'm hitting my W key.  But again, I game a LOT, as I said.  I am very hard on this thing, so a bit of wear is kind of expected.  If they sell replacement keys I would absolutely buy them because I really enjoy this keyboard. Maybe a gamer pack of keys - WASD and space bar only?",
    "31": "Bought to make work more fun and then changed it out for our home computer.  We have an excellent base \u201cgaming\u201d computer that we play Fortnite on and use for bills, etc.We hooked this up and love it.  It\u2019s a very soft and easy press keyboard. No long keystrokes- keys are slim to reduce amount of time it takes to press button and prepare for next button\u2026. And stays quiet when I sneak on to play while kiddos are downstairs!Mouse is great, easy customizable and has ability to add/reduce counter weights if you\u2019re that technical.",
    "32": "I was skeptical about switching to a wired setup, however, I'm very pleased with it. The wires are kind of long but I found a work around to keep the wires out of my way.",
    "33": "First, this review is for the replacement keyboard. The first one, the space bar didn't work, but the style and design are good, I figured I'd give it another try.Disclaimer, I have not tried as a gaming keyboard functions yet. This review is just for regular keyboard and mouse function.-Pros: Quiet, good feel while typing, keys feel like a mechanical keyboard without the loud clicking, back lighting is descent.  A nice looking unit.The mouse is stylish, and will work good \"as is\" but you need to download the free driver and suite (suite loads with the driver). once suite is loaded the mouse becomes very adjustable to your needs.-Cons: Had read other buyers say they had same problem with space bar and other other keys. To me, a keyboard should be about typing first, everything else second. Just me. but this second one works is great. Can't find anything else to complain about, but again this doesn't cover the gaming functions.The mouse. The mouse comes with the LED set to \"slow\" pulse. so if you don't download the driver (suite built in) you have a standard mouse with a red \"heart beat\" back light (default setting). Yes, the light for the mouse can only be controlled from the suite! As I stated it was free Red Dragon site, and installed quick and easy....on my personal laptop.I work remote now and work on a company computer as well. I usually just pop the USB hub from one to the other.But can't put the driver on work computer. Enter mouse with a red \"heart beat\" light for 8 hours.Good for your personal computer, but probably not for a work environment. Will have to live with it for now.Included instructions are basic at best, and even going on YouTube couldn't find a lot of help with what all the programmable/gaming keys could do.-Overall, good value for the price, as my son sent over $120 on his gaming keyboard (SMH).I would just advise to buy \"sold by Amazon\" as I got my replacement within two days.Updated (09/14/2020) On work computer, running large cad program and multiple file docs, along with other programs. The mouse was very glitchy. I realized running though the USB hub made the mouse commands even moving the cursor  \u201cwait in line\u201d to be executed. Not a long delay, but long enough to be aggravating. Computer is brand new, top self HP. So not the computer. Never had this problem with my wireless trackball mouse, with dongle plugged into hub. Not sure if this is all wired mouses or just this one. But I plugged it straight into one of the computers USB ports and now it works fine. Just a heads up. Might be the same for gaming.",
    "34": "I type for a living, 9 hrs a day most days. I am not a perfect typist but have been doing it over 20 yrs so I am ok.That said this combo had some things going for it and some not so.The keyboard- took me a few minutes to adjust from my prior and fingers and movements fell right in nice, nice to type on almost dead silent, key pressure is about perfect in the middle for most, the lights are mostly nice color schemes, colors and brightness can all be changed super easy. The extra buttons are nice to have also.The negatives , you must use the light if you want to see the printing of the letters and numbers at all, the top number row the symbols can be a little hard to see even with brightest color, the front of it is not for me I would have preferred it flat as it\u2019s too short to be an effective wrist rest so I have my normal keyboard wrist rest in front of it, that is my biggest gripe.The mouse to me is fine, nothing bad but not great either, I see some dislike for it but maybe some don\u2019t realize the small button behind the scroll wheel if you press it then it changes the dpi mouse movement speed it has 3 settings, no need to download any software to do that. I just wish I could stop it from pulsating the lights on it constantly.All together I think this is a solid 4 stars, especially when you consider the price.",
    "35": "I love how quiet thr keyboard is and all the color options, although the lighting is pretty dim even with maximum brightness.I use the keyboard for my laptop using a docking station. It's always connected. Anytime I disconnect my laptop temporarily from the docking station the keyboard resets itself. That causes me to have to adjust the color and breathing settings daily and sometimes more often.I would rate 5 stars all around if my settings saved and the lighting was a bit brighter.",
    "36": "cheap and cheap. terrible product",
    "37": "Love the size of it. You really do have to have the lights on to be able to see the normal keys. I have had about a week now and the finish on it seems to collect the oils from my fingertips and has left shiny spots already on the keyboard. It doesnt tilt high enough in the back to be of great use for the feet.",
    "38": "The keyboard is great. Not a fan of the rotating lights when the computer starts up, but it's easy enough to put it back on the color I prefer. I've been using this keyboard for a long time and it's comfy to type on for work, as well as gaming. A solid multimedia keyboard. The mouse is comfortable, if a bit small, and is also great for a mouse. Only negative is that the left main button started squeaking after 6 months of use, and it's annoying enough that I don't use it anymore. It's a plastic-on-plastic squeak, very annoying.",
    "39": "Playing WOW.",
    "40": "Pros:- Seem durable- Keyboard has RGB- Key presses feel like good qualityCons:- Keyboard and mouse are completely mis-matched, not even the same type or color of wires.- Mouse doesn't have RGB at all, it's only red.- Keyboard has limited RGB options, switched with key combo- Keyboard doesn't remember RGB state after powered down.- Volume buttons require use of \"FN\" key combo, instead of dedicated buttons.- Keyboard RGB not diffused, leaving a somewhat sloppy appearance.",
    "41": "The set came without a manual and adjusting the led lighting on the keyboard is not intuitive at all.  Since there was not a manual included, I had to find a tutorial online to get rid of the annoying blinking colors that is the default setting on the backlighting for the keyboard.  Once I figured out how to adjust the backlighting, it looks great and is not annoying.",
    "42": "I bought this as a Christmas gift. As far as I know they are pleased with it and haven't made and complaints about it.",
    "43": "Shipping was fast, the quality of both are really good. I didn\u2019t read the description good, I thought it was wireless but i can deal with it",
    "44": "This was perfect for my young gamer new setup! My kiddo was able to setup solo and get to gaming with no issues.",
    "45": "I'm not a gamer just work from home.Love the lighting and ability to change colorsOne star less for ergonomics just because it's a bit more compact so keying can be off a bit at times.Overall a good buy and paired with the mouse is an upgrade over my old keyboard that had a key break off after a year",
    "46": "This was my first combo that I bought back in 2018. I liked it lasted a long time, the wights in the mouse were unique, and the light were cool.",
    "47": "I really like the keyboard. The lighting makes the keys easy to read, and it has a good balance between give when typing and resistance to provide feedback about my keystrokes. I prefer keyboards that provide a bit of a click when I press the keys, and this one does that. I don't know that it's really any more a gaming keyboard than many other models, aside from the cool logo and backlit keys, but it gets the job done for the games I plan and is fine for work too.The mouse is not great, though. It's too lightweight and doesn't track as smoothly as my current one, and I didn't feel like figuring out how to change the sensitivity setting within my computer, since its responsiveness is very different from other mice I have used on this machine. That's not a big deal, as I bought it because I needed a new keyboard. The gaming mouse I already have works fine.",
    "48": "The keyboard is great. Colors are vibrant and pretty. The only issue we've had is the mouse. I would not count on the one that comes with it- go ahead and purchase another because this one is junk. Still love the keyboard!",
    "49": "Not bad, but when I select a solid/different color after I put my computer to sleep and turn it on again later the color isn't saved. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? Good keyboard though and the mouse's style looks bad ass. (As far as mice go anyway.)",
    "50": "Ok, so I bought this keyboard and mouse combo from Red Dragon back in March 2020. I wanted to spend most of my money on the CPU, graphics card, etc... so I didn't have a ton of money to spend on a badass keyboard and mouse. Plus this was the first actual PC I built that didn't run like a potato. When I found this keyboard and mouse combo for only $30, I was shocked and a bit skeptical. I ordered it thinking it was going to be complete crap and would have to upgrade soon after, but I was wrong! Sure if you ask any pro gamers they would say it's crap, but to me, it was and still is (for the most part) amazing. Much nicer than I thought a $30 keyboard and mouse combo would be. I will say that after about one and a half years of ownership (and daily use), the keyboard still works perfectly fine and has no issues whatsoever. The mouse, however, I can't say the same for. The mouse was great I but noticed about a month ago, the rear side button started getting stuck and not working properly. I died a few times in Call of Duty Warzone because of it and couldn't go back to my previous pages when sifting through my web browser. So I decided it was time to throw it away and get an upgrade. Other than that rear side button giving out and getting stuck, the mouse still worked fine, but I decided I wanted an upgrade anyway to a better mouse with customizable RGB lighting. The keyboard has good customizable RGB lighting options but the mouse was always one solid color, red. Overall, this combo is amazing for beginners! Primarily for someone who doesn't want to spend too much money on a keyboard and mouse that can also be used for daily work, school work, and gaming purposes. Thanks for getting me started Red Dragon!",
    "51": "If you can spare two USB ports, this set is a fantastic bargain.  Maybe there's more customization on more expensive gaming keyboards - this is my first step into the field.  However, everything works great and I honestly have no complaints.  It exceeded my expectations so far (A month or two of use so far).2020 Update:I liked my first Redragon set enough to buy a second set for at work.  The price is still right, and everything still looks and feels great.  A few things have changed, though.The keyboard is now RGB backlit rather than plain unlit keys with red LED embellishments.  There are FN controls to regulate the \"breathing\" (light-dark pulsing) of the keyboard, which is good because I found it distracting.  The included instruction booklet lists these key combinations.  FN+END pauses and unpauses breathing.  FN+PGDN enables and disables the backlight entirely.  FN+PGUP rotates through 3 still rainbow lighting arrangements.  FN+HOME rotates through 7 monochromatic colors (white, blue, red, green, purple, yellow, and cyan).  FN+INS smoothly transitions through the 7 colors over the course of a few seconds, though to my eyes the brightness was uneven.  FN+UP and FN+DN scale through 4 levels of brightness, and FN+LEFT and FN+RIGHT scale through 4 speeds of animation.For my money, the backlight will be kept motionless on a monochrome light, but to each their own.All told, very happy with the keyboard.  It also features two new sets of buttons above the F-row, which are oddly not backlit.  The set to left of center includes links to My Computer, Search, Refresh, Email, Calculator, and Home Page.  The keys to the right are media controls for Stop, Last Track, Play/Pause, and Next Track.  These are all fine, but unnecessary since the F-row already has FN shortcuts to most of these things, and the topmost row, again, isn't backlit.And we have the mouse.  It feels identical to the previous mouse, though it has 4 DPI settings rather than 3.  There's a catch though, which is that the mouse backlight (red only) is set to \"breathe\" by default.  To disable this, you'll need to download software from the Redragon support page.  Although my mouse and keyboard both list their parts # as S101-3, the mouse is actually a M601-3 CENTROPHORUS.  You'll need to download the drivers for this mouse in order to disable breathing.  All the way left on the software's slider will disable the light fully, and all the way right will leave it permanently backlit (my preference).  The other new thing with the mouse is that a LED flashes when you change DPI; it's flash speed correlating to how high the DPI is.  It seems unnecessary but harmless.All told, my first impression is that the addition of pulsing lights just makes first time setup harder as you need to track down the software for the mouse and learn the keyboard controls.  I want to take off a half point for the mouse not having a hardware option to disable the light, but all told I'll keep my rating at a 5 as the backlit keys are actually an improvement once you learn how to freeze them.*****",
    "52": "The S101 keyboard and mouse combo is a nice and affordable replacement for a basic keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is very basic with no software to program it. All of the LED lighting commands are built-in to the keyboard using FN keys and are very basic. The mouse has software and drivers you can download to program macros, assign buttons, adjust speed, LED light, etc. However, the mouse is just one LED color...red. The keyboard has nice multicolor LED options. Both the keyboard and mouse feel like they are made well and durable. I like the feel of the keys when I type on them, it's also very quiet. Happy with this purchase.",
    "53": "Cool Combo But After 2 months of using it the Spacebar key started to make squicking sound like it got rusted or somthing , other than that the keyboard and mouse are good for gaming , but again , i think its not designed to last more than 1 month.",
    "54": "My job gave me a computer with a crap ass keyboard that had broken feet and the previous guy's nastiness all over the keys.  I could have waited for them to slowly decide when it was in the budget to replace a crap ass stock keyboard with another crap ass stock keyboard, but I decided I had waited long enough.  If I am going to spend the better part of 8 hours staring at a computer, I might as well make it my own.  So I dropped a couple of bucks and got a keyboard and mouse that would be complete overkill for an office environment... and it's perfect.  Why?  Because now my boring ol' office has some uniqueness to it, making me forget I am trapped at a desk.  Now I am trapped at a desk with peripherals that are much better than anyone else.  This may not be a big deal to you, but in my mind, it's better to do the mundane tasks on a keyboard that visually distracts me with colorful bliss.  The mouse takes the feeling of dread I had from clicking that worn out stock mouse and gives me the excitement I need to not only click, but DOUBLE CLICK as well.  I'm sure i could play games and other things with it too.So why did I buy a gaming mouse and keyboard for an office computer?  Because I'm awesome.  That, and think about it... gamers sit there for hours double-clicking to use the Sword of Gondor repeatedly, so it must be comfortable.  Logic.",
    "55": "Love this keyboard. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because my Num Lock light does but work when I have it on. That is no big deal though. Not worth sending it back. I love how easy it is to type on and the colors are cool!  I don\u2019t use it for gaming.",

    "59": "I got this for my office at work. I figured if I\u2019m going to be at my desk all day I may as well have a keyboard and mouse I enjoy using. The mouse is great, adjustable DPI and function buttons are nice. The light on it \u201cbreathes\u201d which is fun.Now, the keyboard. It looks nice, the LEDs are cool and have multiple options for how much of a rave you want at your desk. The keyboard is NOT MECHANICAL. No clickity clacks. That\u2019s my fault for not seeing that in the description. The keys seem to absorb finger oils pretty quickly, it\u2019s very noticeable on my spacebar. There are multiple function buttons but I don\u2019t know anyone that actually uses those, but it\u2019s nice to have the option I suppose. Overall this is a nice, inexpensive set up that is better than a \u201cstock\u201d keyboard and mouse you\u2019d get from your company and adds some flair to your desk.",
    "60": "I use my keyboard anywhere from 8-16 hours a day most days.  I work in a dimly lit room at night and need a backlit keyboard that I can see, but doesn't blind me, and that will last.  Others I've had in the past had painted keycaps that would wear off within 6 months to a year.  I purchased a different brand before I bought this one, then gave the other one away because the backlight wouldn't stay on due to an unadvertised \"auto-off\" feature that could not be disabled.This keybaord is perfect for me.  I love the backlight. There are several modes, but I always set it to a single color and choose my preferred brightness.  It's bright enough without being obnoxious, but it can be turned up to be very bright if you wish.  The keys are average height, they are fairly quiet; they do make noise, but it's not the super loud clacky noise that some keyboards make.  The media buttons work well, but are unobtrusive and require no extra drivers or software.I love this keyboard, and my only nitpick is one of style:  Many keys have an alternate function via the function key.  The symbol representing the alternate function is printed at the BOTTOM of each key, meaning the primary function of these keys is printed at the top of the keys.  Due to the angle at which you see the keyboard (since it's in front of you) the bottom half othe keys are better lit than the top of the keys, so the alternate functions show up better than the primary functions of the keys.  For example, on the arrow keys, the alternate functions for backlight brightness are perfectly backlit, while the arrows themselves are dim.  While this is a minor nitpick, I would prefer to have hte primary function on the bottom of the keys with the alternate function printed above.All in all, even with my nitpick I would definitely buy this keyboard again.",
    "61": "Does everything I need. Has various lighting settings for the keyboard which is nice to have if typing or gaming in a dark room for those who haven't gotten 100% familiar with a keyboards layout.",
    "62": "It's true that you get what you pay for.  I bought this keyboard/mouse set after buying another set for $20.99 on Amazon made by ChonChow (see my 3 stars review there for that) - I almost regretted that purchase because there were more negatives than positives about that keyboard and finally bought this RedDragon after my cat chew through the Chonchow keyboard usb cord last week.  I now wrap my usb cords with aluminum foil - read that cats don't like to chew on aluminum foil.The RedDragon costs about 1/3 more than ChonChow but it's definitely at least a 1/3 better in build quality and so much easier/more a pleasure to use (keys and typing feels smooth, solid and not too noisy).First, the negatives -(1) only the mouse usb cord is nicely braided (sturdy) and gold plated.  wish the keyboard's usb cord had the same quality build.(2) once your PC wakes from hibernate, the keyboard goes back to the factory default setting for breathing rainbow lights mode.  It should not do this, it should simply go back to whatever lighting mode you had it before the computer went to sleep.(3)  please add the ability to also turn off the mouse's light, and the lights for both the keyboard and mouse will go to sleep/auto sleep when they are not use for a period of time (like over 10 minutes), or when you put the PC to sleep.(4)  the instruction booklet is VERY minimal - the bare bones way they tell you how to change lighting effect etc. any non expert keyboard gamer would have trouble figuring out.  How do you interpret \"<1>FN+DEL\"?  Do you actually need to press the \"<\"? etc.?(5) this was shipped to me in its box, unprotected by an outer Amazon box, which is a little worrisome since the mail service can sometimes be rough with packages, and there's not much protecting the keyboard inside except one thin layer of bubble wrap (mine was fine but I'm sure others may get damaged boxes).The GOOD -Reasonable price for overall quality build ($30 for keyboard, mouse and mouse bad).LONG usb cords for mouse and keyboard (they say it's 5 feet long  but seems +6feet!).  As you can see from my ChonChow keyboard review, their claim of 5 feet is rather short and barely could reach from the desk directly below to the PC under the desk.  The ReDragon cords are more than enough to go the distance - very happy about usb cords length.Like the ability to change lighting colors and effects, especially brightness levels, and even simply turning off the keyboard's light.If it continues to work fine in the coming months, would definitely buy again!",
    "63": "I really do love everything about this mouse/keyboard combo...the quality is great, the lighting feature works flawlessly, the mouse is a good size, the keyboard has a nice \"click\" to it, but my only complaint and the reason I cannot give 5 stars is because my CAPS LOCK key on the keyboard keeps turning on sporadically during use.I've had this keyboard since the beginning of November, and it is December 19th and I don't remember this happening at first but it is definitely starting to happen more and more as the weeks go by. In fact, it just happened when I clicked on another tab on my browser and by the time I came back to this tab my caps lock key was on again.Fortunately I have until January 31st to return it, which is what I will probably do even though I love everything else about it.",
    "64": "Let me start off by saying the mouse works great, the keyboard however...has a somewhat frustrating issue.During the cooler months, my house usually gets decently cold. I've noticed that when the indoor temperature gets in the low 50s Fahrenheit, some of the keys (those on the left side of the T/G/B keys) won't work in conjunction with the left Shift key. Left Shift will still work with the keys on the other side, and I can still type with the affected keys by themselves in lowercase, but if I hit \"LShift+a\", for example, to capitalize, it won't register any input at all.I write A LOT, so this very quickly became annoying to deal with. After troubleshooting pretty much everything I could think of, unplugging/plugging back in the keyboard, cleaning the keyboard thoroughly, the only explanation I can come up with is that this board just does not like sub-50 degree temps.Otherwise, the keyboard works just fine and is decently comfortable to use. RGB lighting is very cool and I've had no problems with it. I'll just have to find a better keyboard to switch out to once the cooler seasons come back around.",
    "65": "So had this  keyboard for more then half a year,  and everything on it is still very.  They keys aren't super smooth or sensitive and are well placed,  the brightness is very good,  and everything is in working order.  Mouse is very light and feels well in the hand but I don't use it much.My only main gripe is that,  the paint on this thing is very cheap.  The texture, while nice to handle, feels like a Chinese Knock off toy paint.  It is very  rough and sticky feeling.  Most of the keys are also not well coated as right out the box the RGB will bleed right through them.,  and because of that light coating and cheap paint, the paint has been slowly scraping off from use.  Hell I have a keyboard from the early-mid 2000s that my family still use that holds the paint better then this.Still it is a good cheap keyboard and a good buy.  It is worth the money,  just hope you don't get annoyed by no longer seeing what letter you are pressing.",
    "66": "The keyboard feel is an excellent balance between the traditional tactile (click) of older keyboards and a soft smooth response that comes with newer quieter keyboards.  The backlight is helpful when working in low light conditions (if you need to look for special key combinations that you only use once in a while. Otherwise the type by touch and finding the \"F\" and \"J\" keys is pretty easy with the raised indicators on those keys.  Many of the reviews complain about the response of the mouse.  The slow response that is there by default is a feature for gamers and graphics types who are working on very large screens and need very fine mouse movements (to the pixel level).  This is easily changed by pressing the button on the top of the mouse (behind the scroll wheel - another great feature!). it has 4 settings. Each time you press the button the mouse is more sensitive and moves faster (see above pic).  The mouse and keyboard are great!",
    "67": "This is a great price for a good keyboard (clicky), and gaming mouse. You can adjust the keyboard colors and patterns (breathing light, or solid). There is even a cool rainbow pattern!",

    "70": "I bought this pack primarily for the keyboard to see at night when the wife is asleep.  So for that, the keyboard has fit the bill perfectly.  There's still some abnormalities with it.  Why it needs to start in flashing rainbow mode, among others.  But I digress, so far the keyboard has been a great improvement to my situation.The mouse, well, it's in a box on the shelf.  Put bluntly, I don't like it.  I don't like the goofy holes where your thumb rests, I don't like the heavy texture on the buttons.  Unless your thumb and fingers are made of putty or sopping wet, having a smooth rough texture like this does not provide added grip---it provides less surface area contact on your fingers.  That's less grip.  There's a reason race cars use tires with no tread.So unless you're worried about your fingers hydroplaning on your mouse, rough textures really have no place on a mouse.  Unless you're pounding down potato chips while you use your mouse.  I digress.In all seriousness, my dream keyboard would just be the cubicle-ubiquitous Dell Quiet Key, but with keys that illuminate.  I don't care about ghosting.  I don't care about RGB colors. I don't care about multimedia keys or any of that stuff.  This one looked to have fairly generous lower profile keypads rather than the often-imitated IBM model M super tall, skinny keys which I don't like for typing.  And so far, it's been just fine.  Not as nice to type on as my office drone special, but still alright.",
    "71": "like the quality of the product an the feel of it also",
    "72": "I have been working from a computer for over a decade and I do not know why this is the first time I've actually invested in a quality keyboard and mouse. It does make a difference, a significant improvement! I used to think I was just a sloppy typist and blamed myself for constantly having to go back and fix words in my sentences. After an hour of typing on this keyboard - I quickly realized that I am a GREAT typist and that my cheap \"dollar store\" quality keyboards I've used in the past were the issue! I found myself flying through emails, never having to look down at the keyboard, and trusting that every letter and number I type would actually work and type as intended. The keys feel great, they are responsive and sensitive, and they all work perfectly.I had no interests in the color changing abilities of the keyboard- I just wanted something functional and high quality. - BUT I will add that the color changing is incredibly easy. I looked at the direction book for 30 seconds and realized I can choose any color I want, I can have rainbow colors, transitioning colors, breathing/fading or turn the lights off/on - the options are all very easily to cycle through by selecting the FN ( function key) and any combination of the (insert) ( home) (end) (delete) (page up) (page down) keys. Its very easy to remember and allows the user to select any number of colors or combinations of colors.These are my first impressions of the keyboard- but I am very impressed and agree with the rest of the 5 star ratings. This keyboard has all the functionality I am looking for and the color changing ability and options are easy to use/change and remember. 5/5 stars.UPDATE - Months later, and a few hundred hours of typing and this keyboard has not let me down! I love it and have not had any issues with quality or anything malfunctioning or breaking. Keys still feel great, have not gotten slow or sticky at all. 5/5 Stars.",
    "73": "The review way below was a review that I gave the keyboard AND the seller.  After I wrote the review, I tried contacting the manufacture o the keyboard for a warranty exchange, They told me to go to Amazon where I bought it.  I went to Amazon, they told me to go to the seller, I wrote the seller an email asking or an exchange.  I waited and waited......  Didn't see a reply when they DID reply promptly.  They were willing to exchange the keyboard immediately.  I missed that email and thought they never emailed me back.  I contacted Amazon and THEY ended up sending me out a NEW keyboard......  It was a day later when I caught up and saw that the seller sent an email letting me know that they would absolutely replace / exchange the keyboard as requested.  If needed, I WILL do business with this seller again in the future!  UPSTANDING and a great seller!!!!  Changing the review rom a one star to a total FIVE!!!!!OLD review that is retracted --I am NOT a heavy typer.  I bought this then connected it on The 2nd month o the year on the 1st day.  I CANNOT type the letter in-between the \"D\" and the \"G\" on the keyboard.  I cannot type the month that I connected it because it starts with the letter that I cannot type.",

    "76": "I was looking for a lighted keyboard to put on my home theater PC, that I've found I am gaming on that big screen here more lately.  I was just using an old basic HP keyboard I had laying around, but given I use this in the dark it was of course impossible to see the keys with just the light from the screen.On my main desktop I have a Razer Black Widow, and I love it, so I have something to compare this one to. I didn't want to spend that much on a keyboard for the home theater PC, but still wanted the backlight.I ended up buying this one based solely on the Amazon ratings, and quite frankly, I didn't have very high expectations.  I figured it was Amazon, and if the keyboard was total crap, I could return it anyway.  Boy, was I surprised when it arrived!For a keyboard at this price point, I was very happy to see if felt like, while very lightweight, decent construction.  Amazon shipped it in it's bare box with no outer box, and of course the box was all dinged up from shipping, and I expected it to be broken, but it was just fine.Even more surprising were my first impressions of the mouse. Just the feel of it, it felt like a much more expensive mouse, and having a braided cable at this price point is fantastic.  I wasn't even expecting to use the mouse, as I have a trackball, I mostly just bought this for the keyboard.I haven't tried the mouse in actual use yet, probably going to give it to a friend, but the keyboard suites my needs very nicely. The adjustments of the RGB LEDs are easy to do right on the keyboard.  They key feel of course is softer than the Razer I am used to on my desktop, but I was happy to learn that this brand has a higher end keyboard available with those type of keys, I might purchase in the future.Bottom line, very pleased with this purchase.",
    "77": "The characters above the number key do not light up. It's hard to see the @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) on the keyboard.I might  send it back for that reason.",
    "78": "I really like this keyboard and mouse. I'm not a gamer but I do use the computer a lot for work and school. I got tired of my wireless keyboard and mouse because it started causing some typing delays, it was getting annoying. My husband plays on the computer but has not tried this set yet. He thought it was pretty \"fancy\" after I set it up today. I like that the keyboard doesn't sound like my old one with the clickity-clack, the mouse makes the same clickity sound though, but it's more tolerable than my old one.Light: I like how there are options for the lights. I don't like the breathing different colors as I find it too distracting. So, I'm glad that it gives the option of just setting it to one color light, and one setting of light mode - which I prefer to be just on. The mouse doesn't seem to have that option? It's only red color, and breathing mode.Ergonomics: I love how it's ergonomic. It helps my hands and wrists a lot. Compared to my older one that was just flat (both keyboard and mouse), on this keyboard I can comfortably rest the bottom of my palm on the bottom of this keyboard, and the mouse is shaped to make your hand rest comfortably.If you look at my pictures, you can see that I took of the thing at the bottom of the mouse. I don't know what it is, but I think it's to make the mouse heavier? I thought at first hey were batteries, but I looked closer and they're not. This is probably for a gamer thing.Overall I'm just glad that this came in with no issues. I'm hoping that this will last a long time just like how it should when straight full time gamers expects it to be (well, they would probably get something more durable and expensive). Will update when necessary.",
    "79": "This keyboard is ok, but the fact that I can't use some 3-key combos like CTRL+ALT+DELETE is a deal breaker for me. I can get them to work, but only if I use the right-side CTRL+ALT. I think SHIFT had this problem too. Well, apparently I use shortcuts involving those control keys a lot, as a professional software engineer.I'm pretty sure it has to do with the anti-conflict mechanism they setup. Notice the keys on the left side of the keyboard that are underlined. I think those are all part of this group. On the back of the box, it says \"25-key rollover\".So like, with VS Code for example, if I try to enter a 3-key combo in the shortcut key mapper, it will only take two keys from the left side of the keyboard.So, I'm not a gamer, and maybe this is somehow good for gaming, I don't know; but I kind of doubt it. I would recommend look elsewhere.I can say a couple good things about the keyboard. I did like the light settings they had. They weren't too bad. I also like the key layout. I don't like where they put the volume keys. They should have made dedicated media keys for those. For me, I only use the volume media keys on keyboards; I don't use any of the other media keys. Although I do think the track control keys are nice to have (play/pause, next/prev).I like the fact that it has lights to show Caps Lock and Num Lock. I guess its nice to have \"Win Lock\" if that's something you can do; but I've never heard of it. Maybe that's for Scroll Lock?I would almost give this a 3, but like I said, the wonkiness with the control keys is a deal breaker for me. And I did verify this issue 1) happens on multiple computers, and 2) doesn't happen with other keyboards.Also, I guess, if this control key issue isn't a problem for you, maybe this is an ok deal for the money. But at the end of the day, you need your keys to be reliable, so I would recommend you look elsewhere. It would probably be better to have a basic cheapo keyboard that works reliably and normally.",
    "80": "Overall fine keyboard, but deal-breaker for me is that I can't do keyboard shortcuts like CTRL+Shift+Esc with the left CTRL key (it works with the right CTRL key, though). It's a strange limitation since the left CTRL key works with non-shift shortcuts like CTRL-C, CTRL-V, etc.",
    "81": "This keyboard is working perfectly for my son and his online gaming. The keys are so awesome how they light up in different colors! Coolest keyboard I've ever seen!",
    "82": "If your child asked for a gaming mouse and keyboard this is pretty good for the price. HOWEVER, I promise this is probably not what they're looking for. It's a base quality keyboard with no special functions. It's better than a cheap keyboard but if you're looking for real gamer perifs just talk to your kid about what brand they want. I use this keyboard and mouse for work only.",
    "83": "I bought the keyboard + mouse set as an upgrade from my previous keyboard. I had an old emachines keyboard that I dearly loved, but the print has worn off many keys and some of the keys take considerable pressure to function, so it was time to upgrade. I will be using this for coding and extensive word processing, not gaming, so that's what this review is based on.Mouse: The mouse is nice. It's got a nice weight. The texture on the buttons gives it a good feel. It glides on the mousepad well with no skips. It's plug-and-play, although you need the driver in order to program the extra buttons. (see below) I haven't used the DPI switch, since I wont' need this for my work. The funny little contour points at the back end of the mouse are quite handy for moving the mouse around when selecting large amounts of text. No noticeable delay between click and computer response.Keyboard: The keyboard is ok. I'm kind of a \"banger\" when it comes to typing (I press hard on the keys as I type.) But this keyboard makes considerably less noise than my last keyboard... much softer sound and keypress (if that makes any sense). I was hoping to have the static rainbow illumination for the backlight, but haven't figured out how to do that yet. (see below) My biggest complaint is that it's missing the little notches on the \"J\" key that I used to use to orient my fingers when I begin typing. It has a notch on the \"F\" and the \"5\" on the tenkeys area, but not on the \"J\".Instructions: This is where this set really fails. A very thick booklet is included with this set, but don't get excited. Most of the book is translations. There's only about 3-5 pages of instructions, in very small print (I needed to get a magnifier to read them!), and the instructions aren't complete. The instructions could be written with more clarity about how to change colors, and the website for downloading drivers isn't even listed. AND when you do Google-search and find the website, you'll find that the model number on the booklet (and mouse & keyboard) isn't the same as the one on the website. (If you read the Q&A for this item, you'll see what I mean.)Overall, the instructions are the worst problem with this item. If you can get beyond this, it's not a bad set for the price. Definitely makes you feel like you spent more than you did for the set. :)",
    "84": "I've had this keyboard for awhile because I needed a a new one that was a bit quieter so I don't wake anyone in the house while working or gaming at night. Overall this keyboard does the job in regards to that. The main issues I have are the size of the keyboard and the lights.The keyboard is a bit too small for my hands and gets uncomfortable to use after awhile.As for the lights? The main issue I have is that it always resets itself to the rainbow nonsense every time you turn your computer off and back on. Yes its easy to set the lights back to what you want but I just want the light to remain on the setting I put it on.The last issue I have is that for whatever reason, if I need to restart my PC, the keyboard stops working and I have to unplug it and plug it back in. I've tried different USB ports and even test my USB ports and settings in my BIOS to see if it was a port issue and its not. Its just this keyboard.So overall all I can say is that my issues could just be localized to the one I bought and my own personal feelings towards it. If you have smaller hands and you don't care about the lights resetting every time you turn your PC on then buy this keyboard. As for the mouse, I haven't used it. I have a good mouse and I'm leaving the redragon mouse as a backup when I need it.",
    "85": "Initial findings.I love the \u201csoft\u201d brushed coating on the keyboard it feels nice and over all is very comfortable ergonomically when typing. The keys have good resistance, footprint and travel. They feel like I\u2019m actually hitting keys vs buttons like some smaller keyboards.The lighting effects are fun with a wide range of settings and can turn them off or dim them as needed with a couple keystrokes. Over all a solid buy for the cost.As for the mouse, while not the main reason I bought this setup, it seems like a mild afterthought. The plastic is hard and stiff making it feel like it wasn\u2019t finished, the components like buttons, edging and grips are uneven making it feel like it was put together wrong, the weight and over all feel reminds me of a cheap generic stock mouse you would find in a computer lab or office that came with the dell still running windows 7, that\u2019s made to barely serve a purpose. and nothing more. The finish is textured to give a better grip, but unlike the soft almost silicon texture of the keyboard, the surface feels hard and abrasive. Even the \u201csilicon\u201d grips feel like hard plastic.I do appreciate the sensitivity toggle option for the curser. Having duel screens and a higher sensitivity is amazingly helpful. But every time the computer is put to sleep or turned off cutting power to the mouse the setting goes back to the low sensitivity default so every time I have to reset it.Finally my biggest complaint and the reason for the 4 star review is the mouse is so loud and clicky I cant use the mouse with any open mics because it will wash out any other sound coming through.Over all if you just need a solid keyboard or need a mouse and keyboard combo for general use. Not a bad option. Just expect to be getting a better mouse down the road.",
    "86": "This is a normal keyboard.  I bought in anticipation of replacing another keyboard that was giving me problems.  About 30 days later my old keyboard, was having a problem with a few keys including the return key and I was happy to have this keyboard ready.  I thought it would have some ergonomic qualities.  It has little legs you can set up to change the angle of the keyboard and that is about the extent of its ergonomic characteristics.  The keys are super smooth, so they are a little slippery for me.  My hands are a little on the dry side.  I bought this keyboard, because I thought it was a good deal for an ergonomic keyboard and did not really pay too much attention to the gaming aspect of it.  It has flashing lights that are kind of annoying, but if you read the instruction manual you can adjust them to a single color, flashing and non-flashing or no light at all.  It is very hard to see without a light, though.  Not sure how it will work at night, but I think it will work nicely and in that regard I think it offers something not on my previous keyboard.  In daytime hours it is hard to see the keys, as the characters are not painted on, but are rather are see through .  I would not recommend for anyone  looking for an ergonomic keyboard.  At first I was unhappy with it, but once I figured how to adjust the lights I am okay with it and are actually happy I can use it at night without additional lighting.  The fact that it came with a mouse is an additional bonus, so yeah I would buy again for the price, but I think if I could fight an ergonomic keyboard for the same price I would buy ergonomic.",

    "88": "I bought this combination, expecting it to work out of the box. The Keyboard is beautiful and does a fine job of working for what I intend it for. The mouse... No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.One more item: Redragon makes it VERY clear that software is included with this package. It is most certainly NOT. And they go to great lengths to hide the software from the end user. I have found what I believe to be the software links, but plan to test before I share them here. I will bump up the review one notch if the package works out well over the long haul, but given the mouse issue right out of the gate and the promised software NOT being in the box plus the poor web site support to find the program, I cannot reasonably give Redragon a 5 star rating until these items are corrected.Update: December 2019 - I was able to correct all the issues with that first mouse and the software works just fine. I've since bought this combination of mouse and keyboard 3 more times and had no issues. This truly is a great keyboard/mouse combination and I've made it a standard setup on the 3 gaming systems I've built to date.  Software is indeed on their website but it is a little strange to find - The mouse is on the website as \"Redragon M601-3 CENTROPHORUS 3200 DPI Gaming Mouse \" and has two downloadable executables - The Windows 10 version works just fine. I rarely run the software since it works fine without it but it is nice to be able to change the mouse parameters if needed.",

I mean if you decide to swap this out it\u2019s definitely for a new style because performance wise you wouldn\u2019t go anywhere else. Even the cords hold up well no connection issues at all that\u2019s something I just thought of writing this. Mine is kinda dirty not gonna lie but that has nothing to do with the kbm itself just me being messy. And on top of that it still performs well with no stickiness or detrimental keys. Typing feels good mouse dpi is great what more could you need. I highly recommend",

    "91": "I bought this keyboard in Oct 2020, so it's just about 10 months old.  It does get daily use from me and had been doing quite well till this week.  First the color started to look really odd on the keyboard, like 1/2 would be blue and 1/2 green.  Then keys stopped working.  Now the lights are complete dead.  As it is not a keyboard with painted letters/numbers (the lights were how you saw them) it is virtually useless to me.  I can't see what I'm typing in a dark room or even dimly lit one.  None of the arrow keys work at all either.  Like I said, it was used daily but never harshly.  It never fell.  It's been sitting in front of my computer and I type with it.  I don't even game with it, as my job is too demanding to leave me time for that.  The mouse is still working great....but come on.  10 months before it breaks?  We have to do better than this. ***********************************  Update, the seller did reimburse me the cost of the keyboard, even though I sent it off to the electronic recycling center.  I was happy they did reach out to me and make good on the bad electronics.  I upped my rating from 2 to 4 because had it not broken, it was a nice fun keyboard and I really enjoyed using it.",

    "93": "I really like this keyboard. It's been great. Recently, the right side shift key started acting like the enter key. You can imagine typing in passwords with capital letters or special characters and how many times I've almost been locked out of my account because of this.You have to tap that right shift with the quickness of Batman doing a beat down in one of the Arkham games, or you are hitting enter.I don't eat or drink at my computer. It hasn't been dropped or had anything spilled on it.I emailed customer support just for some ideas. Could I have accidentally hit one of the hidden function keys and not known it, etc? Just looking for things to try to see if I could remedy the issue on my own.Since I contacted customer support on their website, and have heard...nada...zilch...nothing other than the auto-reply. If this keyboard is broken, and I have to shop for another one, as much as I have loved this one, I just can't justify buying another one, so I'll be looking elsewhere.",
    "94": "Writing this around 8 months after purchase: I do really like the functionality of this keyboard but a few months in the black coating start to come off the keyboard in little pieces and it gets all over my fingers which is annoying. Now there are a few keys that you couldn\u2019t see what letter it is supposed to be.  It\u2019s still a great keyboard from the perspective of good backlight features, great depth on the keys, fairly ergonomic, so will probably keep it a little while longer. Overall I\u2019d say don\u2019t expect this to last more than a year.",
    "95": "The keyboard is very silent and feels good when pressing keys. Wasnt expecting such sound proof keyboard so its a huge plus. The rgb colors are bright and works well. Been almost a month and no complaints about keyboard performance. The mouse is on the lighter weight side. I didnt like the side buttons being so small to touch but will eventually get used to it. Keyboards 10/10. Mouse 5/10.",
    "96": "While my friends always made fun of me for buying cheap $15 mouse and keyboards I could have been buying this set all along.  My theory has always been why would I pay $50+ for a mouse and keyboard that I will just break or replace in a years time, just to have fancy RGB lighting, when I can get a basic one that suits my needs for a sliver of the price.  I was right, but wrong!  You can have both.  This set is the same price as buying a basic (walmart ie...) type mouse or keyboard for the same price, and you get the flashy RGB. The mouse even has a DPI option which you wont find with most basic mouses out there.It looks great, for me they are also both comfortable and fits my fingers well.The keyboards RGB is easy to figure out, but the mouse is a little different. It defaults with red and while some say you can download software to change this, I have seen others say its only red in this model. I have yet to do so as I'm fine with the red.  The mouse software is listed under a different model number on the manufacturers website, so keep that in mind if you care enough to go hunt it down and try it out.  They provide no link to this or point you in the direction of it within the actual products box or manual.Regardless of that, for $30 you really cant go wrong....",
    "97": "Ergonomically is fine and comfortable and the quality is okay.",
    "98": "overall the price you pay is fair for the product given. the FN controls are only light based, meaning you can only change the speed and brightness, you cannot set your own solid color but the company does have one for a little more that can. the buttons feel nice and its a full size keyboard. the pre-programed macros up top are a nice feature to have though can be hit by mistake if your careless. package was received in good condition and rapidly. fully plastic but not over the top cheap, and lightweight. good for casual gaming or a everyday gamer. If you play professionally i would spend the extra money on a actual gaming KB, but this is more then enough for a standard MMORPG action ect.  ideally wont have to for a while but would buy again. (ive had the product for a few weeks and nothing bad has happend)",
    "99": "After working in IT for many years I've used a large number of keyboards and mice. Some I've loved and some I've hated.This pair is somewhere in the middle.The keyboard is lightweight but doesn't feel too flimsy. Giving it a twist shows it has some flexibility but no creaking or popping. It uses the typical 104 key style layout with no odd-shaped keys. The cord is straight and vinyl insulated. There are the usual additional multimedia keys (No audio volume?) that so many manufacturers like to tout as a feature and that nobody uses. RGB lighting is controlled by the keyboard rather than the computer and has a number of options. It's bright enough to see the keys in a darkened room except for the multimedia keys, which are not lighted.The mouse is the biggest disappointment for me. The pointer jumps and wanders while used in games which has been a huge cause of frustration for me to the point I'll be replacing it. (I've tried six different surfaces with the results being the same) The cable is stiff and fabric covered in red highlites which doesn't match the keyboard. The mouse is lighted in RED only with a 'breathing' effect, so you can't match it to your keyboard or system color scheme. The weight system is still too light with no option for additional weights. The shape is uncomfortable in large hands and the buttons on the left side are easy to hit by mistake.Value-wise it's not bad with the exception of the mouse. If the pointer instability could be fixed I would recommend it.",
    "100": "This keyboard and mouse combo is a killer deal for the price.  I bought this as a temporary keyboard and mouse as I'm doing a gaming PC/music production/game development work horse.  I was extremely surprised and impressed with the mouse especially.  I play CSGO mainly (as it is all I can run on this laptop) and I usually don't fair all that well, I'm usually 1:1 on my K/D ratio and within the first 3 games I went well over 2:1 and a significant jump in overall kills using this mouse and keyboard combo.  Point being I haven't changed anything about my game play and so from a scientific perspective, this mouse and keyboard setup made all the difference in the world.  The mouse fits well in the palm of your hand and has a nice texture for solid gripping during long game sessions.The accuracy of this mouse is incredible for the price, actually not just for the price, it's just that this is an incredible value for the money.  This may end up being a permanent keyboard and mouse for my gaming PC after all.The keyboard is as advertised, RGB back lit and color changing with various options including the ability to choose one solid color.  I actually like the \"spectrum\" color shifting and I also love the ability to maintain a solid color.  The keys are very quiet (not clacky like a mechanical keyboard) and this is due to the membrane style rather than individual switches like a higher end keyboard such as Razer.  I'm not saying this is better or even comparing just letting you know this is NOT a mechanical keyboard, if that is your preference do not buy this.  I prefer the silence of the keys and they are extremely responsive, even while gaming.It's to be seen as to how long this combo will last but even if I only get a year out of it, at less than $30, it's still a solid deal.P.S. The mouse I'm currently using is a wireless BlackWeb and it's about $6 here on Amazon, I actually purchased it from Best Buy about two years ago, and it's fine for an all around mouse but for gaming, you definitely need something better such as this combo.  The BlackWeb has a rating of 1600DPI I believe and if I remember correctly this one is double that at it's highest setting and it's noticeable.  I cannot imagine what a truly high end mouse and keyboard combo say from Razer would do for my gaming.",

    "103": "Great for games",
    "104": "We like that the keyboard and mouse are wired.  It makes things easier to manage.  After extended use with grubby hands, the keys started to stick.  I pried up one of the keys and the key sits inside of a smallsquare tube.  The key slides up and down on the inside of the tube.  So, cleaning the key and the tube restored the function.  Very easy to do.",
    "105": "Tactile feedback is good on the keyboard, but it's taking a bit of time for me to get used to the layout of the keyboard compared to my old trusty Dell keyboard that this was replacing. That, I'll chock up to just me needing more time to get used to it. The weights in the mouse make it feel nice. However, there is no official software for the keyboard, which resets back to rainbow puke every time I boot my computer, which with my ADHD is distracting. The website doesn't officially support the mouse anymore, but the M601-3 mouse drivers and software are compatible, which also helps to remap the buttons. Ordinarily I'd like to turn off the lights for this keyboard, but with them off, the keys are really dull, so I leave them on a solid red during use. Also, was afraid that my keyboard was broken on arrival, but it just doesn't work in a USB 2.0 port and needs USB 3.In short:Pros:Looks niceKeyboard is programmable for RGBGreat for typing at nightKeyboard and mouse have nice tactile feedbackMouse buttons can be programmedShortcut buttons are nice.Cons:Layout may be slightly off compared to what you are used toKeyboard loses your RGB settings if your PC is turned offSoftware was a slight pain to find (You need Red Dragon USA, not the worldwide site, but if you are on the worldwide site, you can use the M601-3 driver download)Needs USB 3.0+ for the keyboard, USB 2.0 ports would not provide enough power for it to functionNo software to reprogram the shortcut keys or maintain the RGB settings on the keyboard.",

    "107": "Pros:Mouse is very responsive and the feel is great.Keyboard has a great deal of RGB colors though I typically use only 1 color.Cons:Mouse's lights can't be turned offThe Keyboard keys are membrane type which are ok but I've had better ones in the past that have better response for typing. Membrane keys are ok for gaming, not my first choice though.Slightly less noisy than mechanical keyboards but still not that quiet, I was looking for a quieter one.Unknown:Durability? Only used it for about half a year so far so it's hard to tell right now. +I do turn off keyboard lights when I don't use it.",
    "108": "Keyboard works fine but I hate the lighting effects. There is no constant on or off just brightness and rate of blinking. I have not used the mouse yet.",
    "109": "Quality is about what you would expect for a $15 keyboard and $10 mouse, but with the added features of backlighting and macro/dpi for the mouse. Not really \"gaming\" quality, although the software does offer macro creation (see walkthrough below for software use).Keyboard:This is a tall button, ANSI format keyboard with double function F-keys (volume, play, email, etc). The tall keys can be bothersome if you're a writer, but the feedback is good and they are fairly quiet. I can type next to my sleeping toddler without waking her up. The lighting function controls were easy enough to figure out and has rainbow, rainbow shift, steady solid color, and solid color breath settings (and off). Color control is done with Function+Ins,Del,Home,End,PgUp,PgDwMouse:Red color breath or off settings. You can adjust the breath speed and on/off with the software. Mouse click is audible, but not super loud like some cheap junk mice. Button clicks are a little sensitive so if you rest your hand on the mouse you might find yourself clicking them on accident. DPI function works fine out the gate, can be further adjusted with software. Side button assignments require the software to change.for software go to the redragonusa site, downloads section.Use the M601 driver (you can tell by the picture). It's a .rar file so if you can't access it you will need something like 7zip (freeware). Once you install that everything is self explantatory except the macro creation. You can find how to videos if you search it.Basically, go to Macro Manager section > Create new > click the \"Record\" button in the bottom right > Type in your macro (ie Ctrl+C ) > Click Record again to stop > Go to Button Assign section > select Macro from the left drop down box > select your macro in the right drop down.Note: just got this so no idea about longevity as yet. Hope this was helpful :)",
    "110": "The keyboard itself is great. However, the keys don't light up all the way and it makes them seem worn. I'm not sure if this is just a defect or how it is intended. I have turned the keyboard brightness all the way but the problem persists. It also does not scroll the light. The closest thing to this effect is a blinking of different lights. Everything else I have that has RGB has a scrolling effect. I'm not too happy about this being the one thing that is different. Aside from that though, the keyboard is great.",
    "111": "Been using for a few weeks.Mouse and Keyboard are great if you're on a budget.Wish the keyboard lights were brighter but overall, happy.",
    "112": "The keyboard is a membrane type, the keys can be a little hard to press down (not impossible of course). It has several backlighting settings (7 colors blah blah blah I'm sure you can read the product data. The backlighting works without other software). The cord to the keyboard feels like it could last a while.Personal opinion (like all of this...): the mouse is the best part of this combo. Its a 6 button mouse (2 \"regular\" mouse buttons, 1 button on the click wheel, 1 just above the click wheel that changes the DPI settings, and 2 buttons in the right hand thumb location.) The mouse has red lights that breath by default (though you can turn this off through somewhat glitchy software that works 1/2 the time. But your hand is covering it when you use it...so it'll probably be ok). The USB cord has a braided jacket that feels like it can take alot. It has a weight system that you can customize (personally I use 1 of the weights for a lighter feeling mouse). I have large hands and am right handed, and I like that the mouse fits my hand well. The thumb buttons on the mouse are closer to the desk than some other mice I've used. I use a photo manipulation program often with it and the ability to set DPI higher at the click of a button is pretty useful. It also comes in handy when you run out of space on the desk (because sometimes I have papers, electronics projects etc. that are also on the desk)I'm curious how long the mouse and keyboard will last (I've had them for just under a month with daily 2-3 hour use at the time of writing this). And I'm guessing they'll last a while due to the cords.Overall: the keyboard takes a touch too much work to press the keys down (personal preference) but seems solid and the lights are fun to play with (though IMO the lights are nice but not essential). The mouse meets every need I have.",
    "113": "The media could not be loaded.",

Mouse light (red) kept \"breathing\" and adjusted by turning off light w/ a redragon driver app (chose not to dwnld Synapse but that's an option). This combo was an excellent & economical purchase that easily meets my needs.",
    "116": "You can certainly pay more and get better gear, but this stuff is solid. I am not a fan of wireless keyboards and mice so this was right up my ally. The mouse is ambidextrous.

    "119": "I've only been using it since yesterday, but I am already won over by this keyboard and mouse combo. Now, the M601-3 Centrophorus mouse is great. It's heavy, glides smoothly, the buttons are responsive, and the size is just right for my hands. That alone is worth the money, but I'm not focusing on the mouse in this review, but the keyboard.This keyboard is a delight. Typing on it is comfortable, the keys are sturdy, give a nice tactile response, and aren't so loud as to wake sleeping members of the household as I type. There was a time when I could type 130 WPM with zero errors, but for years that number was severely reduced due to a number of issues: carpal tunnel, arthritis, and poorly made keyboards. Right now I'm typing around 110 WPM with zero errors, and the keyboard isn't even breaking a sweat. This is probably the best it will ever get for me, but I am already amazed. I never thought I'd be able to type this fast ever again, but the keyboard is laid out in such a way, with the keys themselves offering a terrific response that lets my fingers bounce from one key to another without any interference or lag, that I don't even feel like I'm straining at keeping up the pace.I realize this isn't a mechanical keyboard, but it does feel like one. I mean, if you can't afford a mechanical keyboard, the Redragon Harpe K503RGB is a fantastic deal, and I haven't even got to the fun part yet: the lights!As you know from the description, the keyboard lights up in a rainbow pattern, as well as 7 colors, including my two favorites: purple, and white. It also has a spectrum option which shows a steady rainbow that doesn't blink, or you can have one that \"breathes.\" It's all rather lovely, and it's a dream for me to type at night. I touch type, but sometimes you need to see the keys, even in the dark, and I have no trouble seeing where my hands are placed, or where I'm going while I'm typing at night.All in all, I got this combo for a steal. $30? It's easily worth twice that much, IMO. As a budget gamer, I never thought I'd be able to afford a keyboard and mouse with this kind of quality. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a lot of money, but would like to be productive as a gamer, as a typist, and as a general computer user.5 out of 5 Stars. Buy it.",
    "120": "ok first off I did not buy this for gaming i needed a new keyboard because a cat decided that my keyboard was a great place to cough up a hairball on my keyboard and I work from home.  well after the dogs ate the hairball off the keys I found the left over mess and got to work.  After popping off the keys and doing a  cleaning the L P and space bar were all sticking.  like it took me 5 min to type the word approve because of that letter P.  So i ordered this keyboard 1. the price. 2. the pretty lights on the keys and 3 it could be shipped the next day and work wouldn't be that interrupted.So I get the keyboard after struggling at work all day I excitedly connected it and tested it out. and OMG the letters G and M were not responding on the new key board....(insert allot of screaming yelling temper tantrum and foul language)  I set up for an exchange with amazon the next morning they told me my replacement would take 2 days... I couldn't do it... I cancelled the replacement logged into best buy and ordered the same keyboard from them but I was able to pick it up the same day on my lunch hour.I got the exact same keyboard I had ordered for the same price and EVERYTHING works beautifully!  the only issue is i wish the keyboard was more to the right but that's more of how my work space is set up than the item.  So I'm giving this keyboard 3 starts because the first one I had was faulty but the 2nd one works great.. but remember I am not gaming just data entry so I do not need the speed of a gaming keyboard so it wouldn't really be fair for me to comment on that.",
    "121": "I LOVE this keyboard. It's absolutely perfect. Now, I've always been a PC gamer, but I've never purchased a gaming keyboard or mouse. . My first keyboard was just a plain black Logitech keyboard that I've owned for five years, and my mouse was a trackball. Now see, I've always wanted a keyboard that glows. The Alienware keyboards looked so beautiful with the ability to customize the colors. But I guess I decided..Why do I need that? I've been typing ever since I was a child. I have the locations of every key memorized. I don't even have to look down anymore. Eventually, I found the mouse and figured I'd give it a try. My finger was just getting ready to hit \"Proceed to checkout\" when all of a sudden, I saw this combo.So I figured..Why not kill two birds with one stone?The set finally arrived after a dramatic week of waiting. I'll tell you right now..When I opened the box from Amazon, and pulled out the case, I was absolutely ecstatic! After I opened the box, I spent a good ten minutes admiring the set, clicking the mouse, and feeling it in my hands. The braided cord was an excellent touch I've never seen attempted before. But when I plugged the keyboard and mouse in, I knew that I was inlove with this set. The product images don't do well to represent the backlight. It's a lot brighter than I expected, which I love(Remember, I wanted a keyboard with glowing keys). But the mouse has the best glow to it! Anyway, it has three DPI settings on the mouse which has proven very helpful in FPS games. And it has two side buttons, which I haven't experimented with yet, BUT I notice that either them act as a \"Go back one page\" and \"Go forward one page\". Even more convenient is that I can open a new tab in Firefox by clicking the scroll wheel.I have to get used to the raised keys, as well as using a mouse instead of a trackball. And of course, there are the numerous multimedia keys. The \"enter' button is a bit farther like the others have mentioned, but I honestly don't find that a con. It's something that I immediately got used to upon using it.In conclusion, I love it. I thought I'd immediately regret this purchase, but I just don't. I love this keyboard, and the mouse is spectacular.",
    "122": "For, what I'd call, an \"entry level\" set, inexpensive, fairly solid with good feedback on keys and DPI on mouse.I'll give ReDragon props for flashy.  This is one flashy keyboard, the solid backlight setting is great, especially gaming in low-light. I still have attempted the \"changes color with each keystroke\" but would likely be a strobe effect.Warning: There is no downloadable software, all the settings are manually done at the Keyboard or Mouse. The only reason I can't give it a 5-star. This is why it is a good entry level gaming setup. No macros to program, it would be up to the game to keymap, but macros are out. The DPI setting on the mouse resets each time you shutdown/restart the computer, so you just need to click the DPI selection button. Same goes with the Keyboard, the FN Home, or FN END will change the backlighting. The instructions have a page on which each does.I'm not a fan of the \"no memory\" aspect of the keyboard and mouse, but the cable length, funcitionality and feel of the keyboard, a well weighted full sized mouse. Oh, cable length is good to longer than expected, I think about 5'. The mouse cable is braided.It's really not a bad set, I might get one of ReDragon's higher end KB/Mouse over the more \"common\" brands out there. Sometimes you just need a flashy keyboard and mouse and don't want to spend a ton on something else that is really only marginally better than this one. :-)",
    "123": "This keyboard and mouse work. They're perfectly serviceable. The light options on the keyboard are nice. That's the extent of the good things I can say about this set, unfortunately.To start with, the mouse. I thought I was getting a five-button gaming mouse (not including scroll wheel): I did not. The two side buttons are MACRO playback buttons that require Redragon's propriety and obviously-machine-translated software to function. The macro function sucks because it doesn't have good manual editing; you cannot type in a set of instructions to push X button at Y time, etc, etc, the way you could with AutoHotKey. You have to record all the keystrokes in the correct order and manually edit the timing/delete anything. But you cannot add!You CAN assign the side buttons - and, for that matter, the regular Mouse1 and Mouse2 buttons - to other keys. However, you CANNOT simply assign them to, say, Mouse3 or Mouse4, as those options are anomalously missing. You may only assign it to Left or Right Mouse, or a bunch of special windows keys like IE Forward/Back, Multimedia, Mouse1/Mouse2, Internet Explorer special keys, and the like.The middle button, below the mousewheel and between the left and right mouse keys, is not a mouse button! ALL it does is swap between one of four programmable mouse input DPI steps. This seems mostly superflous to me, as you can set the mouse's DPI in the software. I wouldn't mind so much if \"switch between DPI settings\" was an OPTION and I could reclaim that button for, say, Mouse5, but nope! That is absolutely, positively ALL it does.The keyboard has some FANCY light options, I'll give it that. The instruction book is reasonably helpful at explaining them all, too. Annoyingly, they're only a set of input-based options from the keyboard's own function key, and NOT programmable via the software - which has nothing at all to do with the keyboard. Furthermore, the mouse only has one color - red - and you can only choose between light on, light off, and if it is on, change the speed of the mouse light's breathing. These products are obviously not made as partners, they're just two different products manufactured by the same company and sold as a set.The keyboard, also, feels cheap. See also the damage on the S, D, N, M, and . keys in my picture above. I have only had this keyboard about six months (arrived mid-April 2019, photograph taken mid-September 2019, day before the date-of-posting since midnight has just passed as I am typing this,) and it's already visibly worn from use. This is the kind of keyboard that's made to be unboxed immediately before a PC gaming pro sets down for a tournament, it doesn't feel like it's going to stand up to two decades of wear and still be functional the way my last keyboard was - and still is, though filthy and with many keys worn physically through. I bought this combo for the mouse, which, speaking of cheapness;The mouse is also bloody cheap, too. It FEELS nice and solid and thunky and heavy in your hand - that's because there's a bloody great mass of sodding metal weights inside it! You can pull them out to adjust their spacing and numbering if you like, so that's nice I guess, but with them all out, if just looks feels like a generic Logitech corded mouse going through a Goth phase.In conclusion, they work, they're cheap enough and if you like \"gaming\" stuff, or dragons, or black, or colors, or fancy rainbow cycling lights and you need to replace either or both of a keyboard or mouse, they'll do the job. But do not expect a gaming mouse (it is not,) or a gaming keyboard (it has literally no gaming features whatever.)",

I had to pull out the manual (see pictures) and I'm copying it here for reference. Hopefully this helps you like it helped me.So there IS a way to choose solid colors. And there IS a way to cycle through colors WITHOUT breathing (which I prefer).Cons:- No software- Confusing when first using.Pros:- QUIET. I know this is a mesh keyboard, but man is this so much quieter than my mechanical keyboard.- LOTS of buttons. I kinda geek out a little about all the options to control things from the push of a button right from the keyboard and this has lots of that.So even though I just started using this I think it will grow on me. Maybe I'll come back and update my review later and give it an extra star if all else is well. Overall I'm now happy with this purchase once I figured out how to use the dang thing.",
    "125": "You wont go wrong for the price. Just like anything else that you buy through Amazon Prime this guy came to my home quickly. Everything was packed up nicely and well protected with air bags covering the actual keyboard and mouse packaging. Granted, this isn't going to be the best keyboard mouse combo out there but for the price, I don't think you'll find anything better out there. The red lights looks good on both the keyboard and mouse but aren't too bright. The mouse wheel has a nice feel to it but does require a little bit more umph to move it then other mouses sometimes need. The mouse definitely isn't small, but I only have normal size hands for a guy and my handle cradles it just fine. If anyone out there with small hands is wondering if they can use this, my wife (with VERY small hands) says that she really likes how comfortable the mouse is.  The 3 dpi setting are nice and luckily with where the button to change the dpi settings is at, you're not going to accidentally hit it. It's also nice for me switching to a lower or higher dpi depending on the game that I'm playing or the program that I'm using. If you have any questions or anything I'll be happy to answer anyone's about the keyboard or mouse.***EDIT*** I've decided to update this review. After putting in about 200 hours of CS:GO using this keyboard and mouse set up, I feel like I've put it through it's paces. The only issue that I've come up with was binding keys to the mouse buttons 4 and 5. They're a little tough only because instead of using the options menu I had to manually type in the binds through the console. Other than that I've had no issues. The Keyboard is a bit on the louder side but not much more than any mechanical keyboard albeit much louder than a chiclet keyboard would be, but that's to be expected. As far as how noisy it is when I'm gaming, since I'm really only using WASD a bit of the shift key and then tab, I haven't had much noise. The most important thing is that the wife doesn't get annoyed with the noise so there's that. 200 hours later this is still a 5 star extreme bang for the buck keyboard/mouse setup.",

    "127": "This is a great keyboard - I replaced my Logitech G15 with it (spilled some water on it and after 12 years CTRL and Win keys stopped working on the left side) - I was looking for a replacement and after Logitech wanted 80$ for their current G735 and also 250$ for a G15 (probably because its vintage) - found Redragon on Amazon with many positive reviews for 35$ and decided to try it.Keyboard keys are soft and fast - I am typing the review on it. Also quiet - no loud clicks that disturb yoga class taken in the adjacent room.Mouse - similar to Logitech G9 (i replaced it too).I do miss the LCD screen that was showing me CPU/RAM utilization on Logitech, but for 35$ - its a good keyboard.Try it - I don't think you'll regret it.",
    "128": "This keyboard/mouse combination works for me both in feel and appearance. The mouse is uniformly lit and you can also program the keyboard to do the same - I have a personal preference - not liking the RGB flashing all sorts of colors and modes. You can do that, but I just prefer solid color, bright and on all the time.The mouse fits well in my hand, which is something I can't say for many of them. I don't, nor plan to, use these for any gaming, as our primary function here is building custom computers and do photo editing. This set is perfect for us.Once everyone here gets to try the set, I will probably buy 8-10 more for the rest of the employees.",
    "129": "Great keyboard. A bit loud, which I love. Nice clicky feeling and no resistance with the keys. The lights are nice and still going strong. I use this for gaming and have used it for work so it's held up to pretty heavy use.",
    "130": "I got it as a replacement cause my Corsair ended up dying a horrible drink death, and got this on a lark for temp use till I got my replacement...... and dammit i like this thing better than the one i had for three times the price.... the membrane keys actually feel good (god that was a weird sentance to type out.) and honestly this thing slaps, for the price can NOT be beat, the mouse that comes with it is pretty good, but i intend on replacing it soon, but if you didnt already have a gaming mouse or you need a spare the one that comes with this one is actually awesome for just a free add on.",
    "131": "This is a good backlit keyboard for the price, but the included mouse is a painful nightmare. The keyboard has several colors, pattern options, and brightness level that let you choose between something flashy or less distracting. Letters, numbers, and symbols are large and easy to see clearly when illuminated. Keys are a good large size and very comfortable to type on for a long time, without being loud enough to bother other people a few feet away. The biggest downside is that the keys are too dark to read with the backlight off, so you will always need the backlight on to use it. There is also a very bright red LED for the Num Lock indicator that you may want cover with a piece of black tape. Overall, though it is a good backlit keyboard for all day typing and better than expected for $40-$50.The included mouse, however, is small and anyone with larger than average hands will have to be clutching it wiht your whole hand tightly wrapped around it. The mouse also doesn't slide easily on a mousepad so you must also hold it tighter and push harder to move, which made my hand and wrist ache almost immediately. I tracked down mouse customization software on the manufacturer's website and still couldn't make the mouse any easier to move. The mouse also has bright red lights that can't be customized or turned off to avoid distractions or eye strain.",
    "132": "I\u2019m not a gamer but I do use the 10 key pad often as I work with numbers. I\u2019ve had two different keyboards before finding this one. My original one was too loud so I tried a jelly and it was just too uncomfortable.I do like this keyboard because it gets pretty dark in my place so the lighting on the keyboard is a big plus. I also like that the keys are high (I like the feeling of it). The only thing that I have an issue with is the 0 button. I haven\u2019t been able to figure out what\u2019s causing this sound. It sounds like two things: 1, the button is getting stuck and 2, dry skin running on the button. It\u2019s neither though but the sound of this really bothers me lolThe mouse is nice because it\u2019s wider than your usual mouse but I had to stop using it because I do have arthritis. So I use the keyboard and a trackball mouse which helps a lot!At this point I\u2019m just going to keep this because it\u2019s already been 2 weeks...I\u2019ll just have to get over this 0.",
    "133": "First, I'm not a gamer, so why did I get this keyboard?  Simple, I needed to use my computer, at night, without turning the room lights on.  I didn't need all the fancy lighting schemes, but a simple white works very nicely.  The keyboard is well constructed and the keys give you the feel that you need.  They aren't completely silent, but the sound level is definitely no objectionable.  The extra keys at the top are quite handy.  If I want to nitpick, the only negative I can find is that the contrast between the characters and the key's background, is not as great as it could be in some room lighting conditions, but hey, that's what backlighting is for.  BTW, the keys are easily read with the backlighting.The mouse fits my hand perfectly.  The old one that came with my computer was too small.  The various DPI levels are more than ample for my needs.  The only thing I could complain about is that the macros for the side buttons seem to be sequential, only without provision for concurrent key presses such as, Ctrl-C, or Ctrl-V, as far as I can determine.  But since it's designed for gaming, rather than copying and pasting.  It's not its fault.",
    "134": "The feel is just impressive...this is the best keyboard I have owned in many years.",
    "135": "I love the brightness the colors and the light and how you can change them but I found it to be awkward at first hard to adjust to after using a different style of keyboard I use mine mainly for writing cuz I'm a amateur writer but it's mostly comfortable it's it's nicely on my desk and once I've gotten used to it's gotten easier to write with one thing I will say is I wish some of the keys were bigger that's it otherwise great keyboard four stars you should definitely pick this up with you thinking about it haven't tried the mouse out yet I have a wireless that o really like.",
    "136": "Simply can't beat the combo for the price. Works as needed.",
    "137": "I have become spoiled with the backlit keyboard on my laptop, so when I found backlit keyboards, I was ecstatic. The keyboard has a decent feel, and the travel distance is reasonable as well. I love the different color options and being able to select the color and brightness level for my working conditions. As a writer, I find this a decent keyboard with a better feel than the keyboard on my laptop.The only complaint I have is every time you turn on your computer, the keyboard defaults to a rainbow blinking mode. Yes, it\u2019s easy to hit the FN key + Home to scroll through the color options, I just wish it would remember the last setting.The weighted mouse feels good in the hand, and the light looks cool too. The buttons feel good. The scroll wheel is a bit shallow, but I got used to it quickly. My only complaint here is the lighting option, which sometimes resets back to the default for no apparent reason. To control the lighting on the mouse, you need to download an app from the manufacturer\u2019s website. To stop the mouse from blinking, you need to select the fastest option, which seems counterintuitive. A minor issue, but not one mentioned anywhere, so I had to figure it out myself.",
    "138": "I got this proudct pretty quick in a box that did not look harmed in any way thank god. The combo is nice and I like the style it has especially for the price it is offered in. I came across two issues when I first plugged them in my pc though.1. The left click of the mouse would stay down and not come back up meaning that a click would not register. After some clicking though, I guess the mechanical parts inside \u201cfixed\u201d themselves because after clicking multiple times I never had this issue again.2. I could NOT find the drivers for this mouse and keyboard anywhere on the internet at all. I saw videos and downloaded those drivers, but basically finding the drivers for these is near impossible since not even the REDDRAGON website for these products have the drivers available for these. So I basically have to live with this for now.Other than that the product was pretty nice and so far I am not having any issue with it since June 03,2021 - Present.",
    "139": "I've been using this set for a while now, and it works great.",
    "140": "Honestly, there's not a lot to say about this keyboard and mouse combo. For the most part, it's a no frills combo that will get the job done for us gamers on a budget. I've been using the combo to play extended sessions of Ring of Elysium, and I haven't missed a beat.Keyboard feels great to type on, and has a decent sound when keys are pressed, which is satisfying. I really like the RBG as well.The mouse is fairly light, even with the weights installed. But it feels very precise and smooth. I also enjoy that there's a program to download that lets you do some small customization such as setting up macros, changing DPI (up to 3200), and changing the speed of the breathing affect for the red LED.Overall, this is a basic, and inexpensive, solution for PC gaming. Hard to go wrong.UPDATE 12/36/18:Took me some time to get around to making this update. Life has been a bit of a pain lately, but it hasn't stopped me just yet.Anyway, I had an issue just a month or two ago, in which a bowl of cereal spilled all over my keyboard. In a panic, I dove under my desk, and unplugged it. I then promptly took it to my kitchen sink, and ran it under some water to help clean out the milk. This is when I noticed the holes on the bottom. I hadn't realized that this keyboard is liquid resistance, but I was sure glad because I really wanted a milk-free keyboard experience.Just to stay safe, I went ahead and let the keyboard sit and dry, with a fan pointed directly on it, for a couple of weeks.I'm happy to say that, after it had time to dry, and I finished cleaning up any dried milk left behind, the keyboard is functioning as well as it did out of the box.Good going Redragon! Nice to have a liquid resistant keyboard at such a low price.",
    "141": "This is a fine keyboard for such a low price.",
    "142": "By no means top of the line, but if you're looking for something cheap but good, then this is a solid choice. The keys on the keyboard are much nicer to press then cheap office keyboard which aren't necessarily much cheaper, with some basic ergonomics that office keyboards typically lack. In addition they do include some shortcut keys at the top that while not universally useful I do like, specifically the buttons for controlling music. While the light is a little too bright when I'm trying to sleep in the same room, you can turn it off, or control its color scheme with a couple key presses.The mouse is lighter weight then I prefer, but works good enough. While certainly inferior to gaming mice that are three or more times as expensive, it is superior to most other other mice you can get in the lower price range, and have a few extra buttons on the side and a sensitivity button, both features I appreciate in a gaming mouse.All-in-all, if you're looking for an entry/budget mouse and keyboard for gaming, I'd recommend this. They're nothing earth shattering, but they are a notable step up from just using office mouse and keyboard in comfort, precision and utility.",
    "143": "Solid keyboard, works well,  looks nice,  like the transition LEDs.  Only complaint is that the tops of the keys don't light up.  So on the numeric keys you can easily see the \"5\" but not the \"%\" above the five. Figuring out where the $ % & ect. are means leaning in over the board.  Really a pretty minor issue like .25 of a star but can  only do 4 or 5 rating.",
    "144": "The quality is good but every time I start the computer I have to press 2 keys to stop the lights from flashing.",

    "146": "I bought this keyboard and mouse set for my first computer build. I use it for office use and gaming. Overall, it's not a bad set. I do a lot of typing, and the keys are quite smooth and feel like a decent quality. I like how the keyboard has pads on the bottom to keep it from sliding around when I'm working (this is something that my last keyboard was lacking). I also like how you can easily adjust the weight of the mouse. I only have two critiques that are rather petty but still brought it down a star.First, the mouse does NOT change color. This is 100% my fault for not noticing before purchase, but it's rather annoying because my computer follows a green theme, and I have a red mouse that clashes with my color scheme. Also, any time the keyboard or mouse is unplugged or if I shut down or restart my computer, the keyboard and mouse completely reset. This includes anything from the lighting settings on the keyboard to the DPI speed of the mouse. For me, it's a rather minor and petty inconvenience that takes all of ten seconds to fix, but it's still a little annoying, and I don't give five stars that easily.Overall, I think that this is a decent keyboard and mouse set that I plan to use for quite a while.",
    "147": "Update 11/29/2016:It's been over a year. The keyboard is dusty, but all my keys still work, the LEDs are still great. The mouse scroll button has started to slip a little bit the past month or so, but still functional. Great keyboard still. With the key cap remover, it wouldn't be hard to clean it up.Original post 7/24/2015:Pros:-Budget price-Durable-LEDs are nice and not overly bright-Has a matte texture on the keys and mouse that I personally like-Splash resistant-Braided wires-Wires are a good lengthCons:-Mouse needs a mouse pad; not accurate on some surfaces-Keyboard is a bit glossy under certain lighting-LEDs on keyboard and mouse don't have on/off setting-Not back lit-Enter key is shortOther notes:I'm your occasional gamer, looking for quality and durability but minding the price. I bought this set because I was looking into a new keyboard, and I was going to give my old Sharkk mouse to my brothers so I needed a new mouse too. The high reviews got to me so I gave into this keyboard (red LEDs going with my Corsair SPEC-01 case), but personally I was not impressed much. I think the cons I listed like the LEDs, the mouse, and the enter key made me rethink my purchase (I knew these things upon reading the reviews, but bought it anyways because I didn't know my preferences yet). I've adjusted to the enter key already, and I have a mouse pad, but these are just FYIs.Personally if I could go back I would've dished out $50-60 for a separate full size keyboard and mouse. If this can last me over a year I'll be fine with it though. I gave this a four stars mostly because of the price value for the keyboard/mouse combo.The bottom line: I would recommend for people who need a mouse and keyboard combo on a budget",
    "148": "I bought this keyboard and mouse a little over a year ago, and since then it has held up nicely. For the keyboard (at first) the keys were a bit hard to push down (even after time had passed), but eventually I wore them down (I guess they were stiff due to lack of use). The keys have a nice feel, and not cheap like something else you'd buy at this price. As for the mouse, it's actually pretty comfortable when using. I game quite a lot (and as it is currently Summer, all the more), and I was looking for a nice keyboard and mouse where I could feel comfortable, type fast and easy, and swiftly and cleanly move my hand two and fro. What I really enjoy about the mouse is the fact that there are adjustable weights in the bottom. You can easily screw and unscrew the bottom cap, and take out as much weight as you want from the mouse, to give it a more light feel. Now, don't get me wrong, the mouse isn't heavy at all when it's at it's default weight, it's about as heavy as any average mouse you have or will use in your life. SIDE BUTTONS - I (as a PC gamer) always enjoy a couple of side buttons to bind to certain commands or chat messages, and this mouse came with 2 extra side buttons, which is awesome, especially for the price.I'd say this keyboard and mouse combo is good for the price. The reason I did not put an entire 5 stars for my review is due to the angle the keyboard is. It may be just me, but, say, with the Razer keyboards, a few of them have a flat-ish, hardly-angled front to them, where you can easily rest your wrists, and with this keyboard I can't comfortably wrest my wrists down on the keyboard's edge, but that's just me being OCD. Other than that, good keyboard (and mouse).",
    "149": "Stop procrastinating and get this keyboard. You won\u2019t be disappointed. I give it 5/5 stars.",

    "152": "This set is something that\u2019s good as a backup for a better keyboard. I left my good keyboard at college over break and it wasn\u2019t possible to go get it so I ordered this set as a temporary. The mouse does fine, it\u2019s got plenty of weight and the buttons do good. It only displays red lights so if you want RGB this mouse doesn\u2019t have it. The keyboard is what I\u2019m most critical of. The keys are much shallower than typical gaming keyboards so it is really quiet but you can\u2019t take off the key caps. My biggest problem is that the keys are all rounded on the edges instead of square which sucks because my fingers slip off they keys when I\u2019m trying to press buttons quickly. Overall it\u2019s good as a backup set to a good gaming keyboard/Mouse or if you are building a pc on a budget or don\u2019t care about your keyboard/mouse performance. The RGBs look good so it would also work well if you simply wanted a cool looking keyboard/mouse.",
    "153": "It's about what I expected. The media keys are useful. The backlight is cool. I wish it had more effects for the backlight and programmable mm keys. I understand some of these keyboards have software that let's you program them but I don't think that's available for this one. The mouse is fine but I have the problem that it doesn't remember my dpi setting, which is a tad annoying. The action on the keys is fine, definitely not as good as a mechanical keyboard, but much better than some other membrane keyboards.",
    "154": "This is a great keyboard and mouse for the price. I just got a new gaming PC and am going to keep using these until they totally die, but within a few months of having this, I had a problem with the \"P\" key also wanting to enter \"0\" (zeroes) when depressed. I was reminded of this as it began acting up again with my new transition. I use a blower, Q-tip, and IPA to get things cleaned up and working fine again, but it's a semi-regular issue.",
    "155": "For the price, it would be hard to beat this setup.It's a separate mouse/keyboard combo, so any computer that you plug into will recognize it and respond accordingly.  The function key options are nice to and have and have good placement to reach with the left hand specifically.  This is very useful if you happen to have a colleague that tends to be a little louder when they are presenting, you won't have to go into the computer's audio controls to change things.The weights in the mouse are a really nice feature, just because if you like to use a lighter touch, you can pull out some of the weights in it and it's quicker / more responsive.  So if you are worried about carpel tunnel, that could help.Having the up-chevron be the mouse speed toggle is really nice and can very quickly change mouse responsiveness depending on your desk or lack thereof.I really don't use the backwards/forwards buttons on the mouse edge for navigating websites and I do brush against those from time to time on accident.",
    "156": "Bought this in 2020, It is 2022 now and it's still working great. All lights work as the first day I got it. The mouse is only red color, while the keyboard can be any color you want. I leave the mouse red, and leave my keyboard on red to match.",

    "158": "After looking at RGB keyboards from reputable brands, I noticed the REDRAGON combination set to be one of the more purchased sets on the lower budget spectrum. I liked the weight, style and design of both keyboard and mouse; however, when I received my set, I'm questioning if I should have payed the extra money to get set from a more reputable brand.KEYS - half of the keys on my keyboard function perfectly. I have no problems with any of the smaller keys, such as the \"q\", \"w\", \"e\", \"r\", \"t\" ect. or other keys that are of this size, but any of the larger keys, such as the 0, Enter, and + keys on the number pad , the \"shift\" keys, backspace and backslash all have different resistances or don't function properly. They are difficult to press, or do not register when pressed. Half of the time, when the backspace character is pressed the \"=\" sign is entered because of a poor manufacture molding. - Poor quality control, should not have left the factory. Refer to the picture about the fused keys.RGB - REDGRAGON will receive a star for this. For the cost of the board, the RGB functionality is perfect. It is very easy to navigate through the different RGB settings by using the function key, paired with (insert|home|pageup|pagedown|delete) ect. I also like that the media keys functioned properly without the need of additional driver installation.Drivers - I think that it is poor that REDGRAGON states the compatibility of operating systems in the instruction manual but does not provide the download, or its address in the instruction manual or packaging to receive the \"programmable buttons\" functionality.  -1 star for this reason. False advertisement. I still haven't found the software.Weight - The keyboard doesn't feel cheap, and neither does the mouse. They are of the higher quality ( at least material density) from what I would expect of something within this price range. Both the keyboard and mouse are finished with a matte/gloss finish. The mouse is ergonomic in the hand, but has enough weight to hold against the pull of the chord. This was a very nicely balanced design. The mouse also features adjustable counterweights, which is perfect to get the response you need in FPS shooters.Mouse - REDGRAGON gets a star for this -- the color, shape, design and functionality are flawless ( at least with the one I received ). The dpi switcher functions exactly as described, providing instant response during gameplay, or while casually browsing on the operating system. The side buttons have a very crispy click, but aren't difficult to press. I would say it feels \"snappy\" when being used. The chord that comes with it is very lengthy, and made out of a material that seems it will last. I have nothing bad to say here, other than the fact that I can't program what I want to it because of the drivers.Summary 2.5/5 starsI don't purchase myself technology gifts very often, so when I do, I want them to function the as advertised. I think REDGRAGON should reassess its quality control measures to provide the customer with a better product. This keyboard combination set has the potential to be 5/5, but not when half of the set doesn't function as intended. I think I'm going to return this. I shouldn't have to try and fix something that is fresh off the assembly line.",
    "159": "Love the lights, and the fact that these both seem built to last. The keyboard is sturdy, and the keys are very well designed. The mouse is also well built, and I've dropped it twice! (By accident.) I like these so much I bought a pair of Red Dragon speakers for my computer!My only con is that this keyboard isn't very ergonomic. For basic typing, it's fine, but I tried using it for gaming and couldn't make it work. It may be my fault, I'm used to controllers, but it didn't feel very comfortable to me.",
    "160": "It was a decent keyboard for what it costs. I put it to good use for 1.5 years but now a few of the keys are broken, everytime I press \"P\" it types \"/p0\" or some combination of that",
    "161": "The keyboard is fine, but the mouse is underwhelming, and I'll explain why.First off, when I went to look for the program to configure the mouse, it falls under S601 now, not S101 as it is stated. That caused a bit of confusion.Secondly; the DPI toggle is one button. Most gaming mice have 2 buttons to toggle the DPI up and down on the fly. With a 1 button setup, if I am on Setting 2 (1200 DPI) and want to switch to Setting 1 (600 DPI), I cannot toggle UP. I have to go through Settings 3, 4, & 5, and THEN back to 1.That's pretty bad, given that gaming in fist-person shooters is frequently done with a high DPI to look around, then a low DPI to precisely aim. With my old, $20 mouse, I could toggle up and down. With this mouse, I have to frantically mash the DPI toggle to get back to a lower setting.Secondly: Other programmable mouse I have had frequently have different colors for different DPI settings.This mouse has one tiny strip-light that flashes at different speeds, just below the toggle button...In the center of the mouse...Where your hand will be covering it. If you look in the picture, the DPI toggle button looks like a chevron/ arrow pointing down at the light that flashes.Just two horrible design choices that make the mouse pretty lousy for gaming.But at least the keyboard is nice and quiet and feels nice to use.And the mouse feels nice in my hand. It's just got bad ideas, design-wise.",

    "163": "Update, July 20, 2020,After several emails with the company regarding my issues with their product they agreed to refund me for the keyboard and shipping & handling.They did make several attempts to replace the keyboard and mouse, but due to the nature of my issues, I didnt want to take a chance. I've upgraded their rating to 3 stars because the design and look of the keyboard & mouse was cool and they obviously stand behind their products and did their best to try and appease me. Thanks Red Dragon.Bought this keyboard a few months ago because it looked stylish and seemed to have good reviews. Upon receiving and opening the package I was happy.  Fast forward a few weeks later and my pc was turning itself on every night. I did a wake command and determined it was my keyboard and mouse causing it. I tried to go into the device settings and disable it but it would happen again anyway.  I reached out to the company and they did respond quickly and offered a refund.  I thought lemme try to deal and see if it would stop. Fast forward a month and not only has the problem not stopped, now the mouse works intermittently. Whether the pc was on and in use or just powered on the mouse wouldn't work. I'd have 2 unplug and plug it back in. I have 8 USB ports on my pc and I had the issue with every single one. So I reached out to take them up on the offer for credit and was denied because it was beyond the 30 day return period.  Even though they were aware of my issues and offered a previous refund. They offered to exchange it but I'd have to pay to return the defective equipment.  That's when I lost it. Buy at ur own risk. This keyboard and mouse has only caused me stress!",

They are a little tough to get used to if you've been using chiclet laptop keyboards with less than a millimeter travel. But once you get used to them, you'll want nothing else. the lack of latency is also pretty cool. I have only two complaints:Changing the colored backlit feature is a bit of a PITA. You've got a cool but very distracting cascading rainbow by default, and I have to look at the manual to remember how to switch it (it's not clearly marked on the keyboard). I prefer red or purple (the most pleasant, IMHO).The mouse has a cheap plastiky feel on the sides that gets slick with any perspiration. Again, I'm not a gamer and only a businessman. I can't imaging playing some intense game with this mouse unless I put some pine resin on my thumb and pinky because the sides get *slick* with just the slightest bit of perspiration.Otherwise I'm very happy with both of these keyboard/mice sets.",
    "165": "Advertising fails me again! The keyboard appeared to be super bright in the ad photos. Even in a room lit normally, it appeared to be bright. It is not. The keys also are not marked with symbols that are bright enough to read clearly in a lit room. Even in a gaming situation, the keyboard is not bright enough. SO...development team...brighten this baby up!",

I have found the shortcut buttons on the top to be very useful in an office setting to quickly acess files, calculator, ext. This keyboard is not loud like a mechanical keyboard. It makes just enough noise to where you are confident you are hitting each key. The lights look nice and are not super blinding bright to where they distract you. They have a few modes you can cycle though by holding FN and a corresponding button, all explained in the handbook that comes with it. No comment on the mouse as I bought a separate one and do not use the one that came with this keyboard.",
    "168": "The keyboard combo I am reviewing is the Redragon S101 Gaming Keyboard Mouse Combo. First, I was disappointed with the delivery of the package, and why only 4 stars and not 5. It was meant to be a gift and it arrived in no package at all. It arrived in the actual keyboard box with the address label slapped on. I was so shocked to see it delievered like that, anyone could have walked away with it! One side of the box was crushed and we had to make sure the mouse was in there and still working. Alright, moving on...my nephew loves this keyboard and I do too! The keys are soft pressed and a joy to use, it is lightweight but robust enough where it doesn't look cheap. The backlight worked as soon as we plugged it in, hence the plug and play claim. The mouse is also smooth, responsive, and fast. I am not sure if anyone else encountered this, but we were unsure of how to change the backlight colors, we thought it did need a driver but found through sheer luck that to change the colors and variations use the \"FN\" key and press the insert, home, page up, delete, end or page down keys. As well as using the arrow keys and FN adjusts the color intensity and the frequency of the flashing. All in all, I do recommend the keyboard! I am even getting another one for my husband cause he loved it :)",
    "169": "This was my first game or RGB keyboard purchase as I'm not much of a gamer. I bought this keyboard to use for work/school/and a little gaming. I do a lot of typing... A LOT... often, at night. I like to have the RGB so that I can turn out the rest of the lights in the room.The RGBs are bright enough or dim enough if you like. There's only a few different RGB modes, but at this price point, with a mouse... I wouldn't expect much. Initially I really enjoyed typing on this keyboard due to the grippy ruber texture, but that wore away quickly... like within a month. Also, after 3 months, some of the letter keys started to wear away. Also, the RGB settings on the keyboard started randomly resetting about month 4. I have a dual boot (linux/windows) desktop plus a work laptop, all sharing this keyboard via a switch. It's possible that this contributed to the RGB  resets, but I doubt it.The Mouse, on the other hand, is pretty dope. I wish it had more colors but I like the DPI select button and the removable weights inside the base.I ended replacing the keyboard with an RK918 which is WAY WAY more to my liking, probably yours too.",

I wanted something to break up my day and have fun with, but still needed something functional. The key strokes on the keyboard are so soft and smooth, it is quieter than my regular ergonomic keyboard. The lighting to it is very nice and there are so many ways to have it. It does take a while to learn which key functions to use to get it to where you may want it, but it is a very easy instruction manual. Since I am not using this for gaming I will say I am really glad that I did read the reviews and purchase this. I did have an issue with one of the keys sticking, but when I contacted the seller they responded immediately and were ever so happy without question to replace it. I contacted Amazon and after scanning my return had my replacement keyboard sent out the same day and received it the following day. I will definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great keyboard and will see what other items they may have to assist with my new home office.",

Even though it's only three weeks till Christmas I still got my keyboard with 3-4 days was of course very easy to set up just plug in and it's ready no need to do anything on your computer. I had to read the manual just to figure out how to set color on the keyboard which was very easy.  The keyboard itself is very nice and quiet soft keys very bright.  The mouse as well very bright the cable on the mouse is nice because it's red and black which matches my computer table.  This is not one of those really big mouse I'd say average size the RGB is very nice and bright as well just remember to take of the sticker peel on the bottom otherwise the mouse moves slow.  I would recommend this to anyone who might want a gaming keyboard and mouse but doesn't want to spend over $100 a piece for them.",

The keyboard looks fine, I'm happy with the lights. They keys are a good size and so is the keyboard.The mouse feels a little weird for me (I'm using to having keys on side, if you play W.o.W you will understand, maybe?) That's on me though, that is something I will have to get used to. It feels right in my hand, it's got different speeds for the cursor, a bonus as my kiddo likes to use my pc sometimes and they slow down the cursor.I'll add more of a review next month but for now, I am happy with the delivery time, the packaging and how it feels.",
    "176": "I bought this for a friend who is on a tight budget and wanted some RGB. I didn\u2019t expect much considering the price, but this mouse and keyboard are pretty solid.The keys have some resistance and feel similar to my Romer-G\u2019s. I am currently using the Logitech G413 silver which I highly recommend. I expected the keys to feel like a cherry mx red, or just no resistance at all. The caps don\u2019t feel super cheap either and when pressed they are quiet. It has very limited customization with the RGB backlight. It only has \u201cwave\u201d mode but you can control the speed and brightness. You can also turn it off.The mouse feels decent in my hand, I have relatively large hands so it\u2019s a bit small but not too small. I am currently using the Logitech G403 wireless which I also highly recommend, except for I grabbed it before the price sky rocketed so might be better options now. I could easily use this mouse for hours without cramping though so it\u2019s really not bad at all. The mouse has a texture on it which is nice in case your hands get a bit sweaty.Overall I think he\u2019s gonna like this combo. I rated 5 stars because this is a budget combo. It\u2019s not high end but it\u2019s great for the price. Would recommend for someone on a budget looking for some decent RGB.",

It works great so long as you don't need to use it >4 ft away from you computer.Note: the pics are when the system was off so don't show the active lights. They are meant to convey sizes.Mouse: fits my hand perfectly. Has the best notched scrolling I've ever encountered (as opposed to the smooth scroll wheels - I really like the feedback of a notched wheel).Keyboard: well sized and comfortable. The lights are a little bright and distracting for me even at their lowest on setting, but you can just turn them off. The light settings have a decent set of presets so you can make then a solid color or breathing or rainbow if you like distracting rgb on your keyboard. This is not a mechanical keyboard and will not have the satisfying click feedback you will find on the $100 gaming keyboards, but the keys have better feedback than the wireless business keyboard I replaced with this.Both: the cords are only about 5 feet long, which works well for my desktop setup but would be limiting for a console or if your desktop is not right next to your desk. The lights are functional, but I'm not sure why they are on there (I'd be perfectly happy with just dim red lights at night and nothing during the day).",
    "178": "I bought this product so I can set up multiple monitors from my laptop, and not be tied down to my laptop keyboard. This keyboard is terrific. It takes a day or two to get used to if you're not used to mechanical keyboards. But its well worth it. I see that I type much faster and it feels very natural. The mouse is also very nice. The sensitivity option for the mouse is really nice and its a great bonus with the keyboard.Been using the keyboard for ~7 months and the keys are a bit loose. Probably will need to upgrade to a new keyboard in ~2-5 months out (its a bit too loose for me but some people like it broken in). I am using it for all my software development--heavy use everyday--so if you're using this more casually or for business, it will last much longer. Even for software, it will last longer, just a matter of preference.Bottom line, quality keyboard. I think the price is fair. The wires can get in the way sometimes, but the keyboard really holds up better than I expected for this price.",

The keys feel smooth to touch, and although I don't how they will feel overtime they just feel great to type on. The little wrist holder feels nice to use I just wish the little designs on it weren't there but it's still good! For some reason the logo and the top of  the keyboard looks different than in the images shown on the page, but it's not a big change and it looks good! The mouse is a pretty basic mouse in the price range, has all of it's buttons and an amazing braided color. The coolest thing are the little weights in the back that make the mouse feel good and weighty to use, and not floaty like plastic mouses you'd expect to see in the $30 price range. You can take the weights out if you want and get the feel you want but I feel like all the weights are just nice! All and all, a perfect bang for your buck product and if you got the cash, I think this is a pretty safe buy. I have had no issues yet, but will update this review if I get any.

    "185": "It does what it's supposed to do, although I have some complaints about the keyboard.1. The right shift key is sticky.  In my case, that means that it feels like it's cushioned when I press it, keeping it from making that trademark keyboard clicking noise that we all know and love, and make it take noticeably longer to return to the \"unpressed\" position after having pressed it. It makes me think of those doors with air pistons of them, where no matter how hard you close or slam it, the piston slows it down to keep it from slamming hard. This may just be a lubrication issue, or perhaps something wrong with the rubber, but it's still annoying. Even worse, the only way I was able to remove the shift key to try and see what the problem was, was to remove the CTRL key under it, so I could have space to insert a gift card under the shift key to pry it up.  After that, the CTRL key is also sticky. This makes me further suspect lubrication issues.  But this process leads me into my next complaint2. It didn't come with a key-remover device, or whatever you call the little plastic tool that fits around individual keys to remove them.  I have to use a plastic card from my wallet to remove keys, which is necessary to do when they don't work right.  Having the little tool would have made things a heck of a lot simpler.3. I know of no way to change the lighting sequence.  Sure, you can slow the rainbow of colors down, or turn it off, but I don't know of any way to just have a single solid color show, which is preferable when working or gaming at night and you don't want a constantly changing light source under your nose.As for some backstory, I got this keyboard and mouse as compensation after the PC I ordered didn't include a keyboard like it was supposed to. Amazon support was great. They showed me two different keyboards that matched the compensated price point: This one, and another popular one. I regret choosing this one over the other.  You may have a different experience than me, but this is my two cents.",
    "186": "I guess I got my money's worth. The default setting for this keyboard and mouse is to come up blinking all colors. . And every time you turn on your computer, you have to select a color scheme or work on a blinking keyboard.  Also, sometimes, the caps-lock light goes out of sync between keyboard and computer.  Specially when using a remote desktop app. Very strange.  Finally, I've noticed that if I step away from my computer for a while (1 or 2 hours), I'm very likely to come back to an unresponsive keyboard. It looses contact with the PC.  I have to restart my computer. I have no proof that the keyboard is causing this. These things don't occur a lot (except the blinking).  But .. I'm probably going to save some money and buy a new keyboard.. I miss my old Logitech G11",
    "187": "I really really REALLY like this keyboard. I previously had a razer keyboard I paid $50 for and this one has better touch, better travel, nice and quiet and no aggressive bloatware like razer synapse. The mouse could be better but is still high end. The feel is premium compared to the razer gear and every thing is 10/10 ergonomic. The rgb I believe only has one setting but does the job. The design of the keyboard is fantastic I don\u2019t really mind the rgb as much. I recommend buying this today.",

In either case, I may need to be using the keyboard and mouse.  Going lights out has never been easier since all of this lights up. There are different modes which is fun to play around in, but I stuck with solid red, matches my PC anyways. Of course there are brighter colors for better visuals of the keys. The mouse \"breaths\" red, as if the Dragon were asleep and ready to breathe. All of this is quiet. Every button to click and it is not loud and obnoxious, perfect.As for the mouse, specifically, I love the side two buttons which go back in the web browser or forward. I've always loved that and missed it when I needed a new mouse, which is this one now. There is a center button which adjusts the mouse sensitivity on the screen. I usually keep it at one speed, but for gaming purposes, it can help others - I'm too casual to care.My only one gripe about this mouse: It's too big FOR ME. I'm a small lad, and finding a comfortable position to hold the mouse is quite a goal. I still never found it. I enjoy the mouse enough to not care too much about it. Too bad it was not smaller. I'd probably look for a smaller mouse next time. This wireless mouse I got actually has the same things and is smaller - perfect for me. It does not light up though. Being lit up during the night is extremely helpful.",

I don't like lighted keyboards, so this works perfectly for me. The mouse is very dim, so that's a plus. I'm very hard on my keyboards, and mice. The fact they've held up this long surprises me, and goes to show that even inexpensive items can be diamonds in the rough. All in all, I'd recommend this package to ANYONE, whether an inexperienced gamer, or veteran.The Mouse:The L&R click buttons have a grip texture on them, so you don't slip when clicking (Very helpful in FPS games.)The Wheel is very low key, due to the click buttons riding up the sides of it, making it easy to hit both the mouse and either click without taking your finger off the button.The two side buttons are set perfectly to just roll your front and back parts of your thumb to hit them. They're also easy to distinguish between.There is a speed adjuster right below the wheel, two set, and then an off. It's low profile so you don't accidentally hit it while playing.The keyboard is standard, but it gets the job done. I like the feel of the WASD/Arrow keys. It''s easy to tell if you're on or off them. Helps in RPG/MMORPG's.This is a personal opinion review. If you feel you're being misled, or have a different opinion, or anything that conflicts with my opinion, I am more than happy to see your response and will come in with an open mind.

I have smaller hands so wasn't sure how it would work.This is probably one of the better keyboards/mice combos I have bought at a reasonable price point!",
    "194": "I really liked that for approximately 40 dollars it came with a decent gaming keyboard with customizable features, backlight keys, and a nice mouse. Pretty inexpensive gaming keyboard and great for casual and amateur gamers. The keyboard and mouse are both wired and need a USB port to connect. The keyboard is lightweight because of the plastic casing. Multiple features on the keyboard like a play and pause button, volume up/down Fn keys, PrintScreen key, and other fun keys. The backlight is okay, it's muted, and has dull color compared to Razer Blade's keyboard or MSI Raider laptop keyboards' brighter/intense backlights. The mouse felt pretty ergonomic and had like 4 motion settings that you could choose from. I liked it, clicks nice. Don't have much to complain about it.As I game often, the space bar and WASD keys are rubbing off their matte coat as well as the click buttons on the mouse and I had this product for only a little over a week. The only issue is that this model comes with a membrane switch key type, not mechanical keys. I really wished the product description specified that in a more obvious way. And I think because of the membrane switches, I have experienced trouble with gaming because I had failed to register the key by not pressing all the way down (even though I feel like I do). I'm gonna have to return this for a blue switch or brown switch keyboard. Otherwise, it would've been a keeper.",
    "195": "The whole thing feels very nice to use and isn't as loud as some other gaming keyboards I've heard in the past. While you definitely hear the keys the noise isn't obnoxious and quiet enough that you can't even really hear it with headphones on (which is how I spend most of my time anyway) if you're using your gaming PC as a work computer as well you shouldn't have any issue using this for prolonged periods of time even if you're typing a lot.The mouse is pretty cool as well and the only issues I'm having (just after setting it up) are definitely user errors. I can't get fn+home to set it to a solid color but the home button works and the other commands work perfectly. The instructions are a little vague at first on how to do certain things but enough clicking around on the mouse (which desperately needed it's DPI changed out of the box IMO) got me to where I needed it.Edit: There's three home buttons on this thing, if you want the solid color background you need to hit the home button between the \"insert\" and \"page up\" keys. Just in case anyone out there was like me and very confused by what they were doing wrong for a good five minutes.",
    "196": "The mouse isn't that great if you have large hands like me cause you'll end up getting a hand cramp quickly so I ended up replacing that immediately, it felt nice and worked fine but it's too small for me.The keyboard was more than worth the price and I've been using it for 2 years now and it still works fine, the  keyboard and the rgb look great and it's really quiet and smooth as you type or play games.",
    "197": "So far they work fine.  I like the feel of the keyboard keys and I like the shape of the keyboard a lot. The mouse fits my hand well and is smooth, and I like that I can adjust the mouse speed with the button right on the mouse. I can't give it five starts though.  When you buy a \"combo\" you expect to get two like item, but you cannot adjust the color the mouse. So you either keep your keyboard red (which I do not like), or they're a different color.  Small but annoying to those of us with particularities, is the fast that the cords don't match either.  If I had known these things in reading the ad and reviews, I would have bought something different.",

    "200": "First one that was shipped to me had an annoying space button.  Every time the space button or any other low buttons (alt, FN, windows) were pressed, it made a pretty loud springy noise.  I asked for a replacement and when the replacement came, it still was there.  Also, the replacement I assume to be used due to the red dragon clear stickers not being on the logo and the box was a little beat up.  Anywho, the replacement keyboard has the same problem however much less significant.  Space button has a slight springy noise.  Doesn't seem like a big problem but just one of those annoying things you can't seem to get your mind off...Biggest turn off for me (and maybe I just don't know how to fix it) is the background keyboard color.  Let's say I want my keyboard to stay permanently red.  Well every time I turn on my laptop, it streams all the different colors and I have to manually turn it back to red.  Is there a way I can just set it as red, leave it as red, and forget about it?  Who knows...",
    "201": "Overall this is an excellent product for the price point, and I am fairly satisfied with my purchase. However the reason I did not give it 5 stars, which I feel it deserves 5, is because the particular item I received has been glitching since I received it. The dash key sometimes sticks and acts like it is being held down or pressed when I am nowhere near it, which then causes other issues such as the left shift or right shift buttons not working, among other issues. Overall it's a minor annoyance, but for a brand new product this should not be the case. Other than that however it is excellent. The RGB backlighting is bright and clearly defines the various keys, and it is very comfortable on the hands and fingers and easy to use. If mine worked properly I would give it 5/5 stars across the board.",
    "202": "First off, I like this keyboard, and wish I could keep using it. However, it may be that I got the one bad one in the bunch, but that is not the thing that really ticks me off. My keyboard, after using it for several months, all of a sudden, it has an issue where some of the keys stop working randomly. It sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. I thought, ok, lets see if I can return it under warranty. Come to find out, I cannot return it to Amazon, then they turn me over to redragon. I get in touch with redragon, and find out they aren't the ones who sold it, so I can't return it to them. I finally find out the seller is ChallengerUSA. I do my best to find a customer service contact, but what I find is the website for the company does not work. I get in touch with Amazon hoping they can put me in touch with the seller. They can't even find the contact info for the seller. So basically, I am up the creek without a paddle on this thing, and I have no choice but to decide whether I want to keep it for some unknown use, or just throw it away. I feel this is a failing of ChallengerUSA, and in the future, I am going to do my best to avoid buying from them.P.S. It might be a red flag if the headquarters of a company with \"USA\" in it's name, is located in Hong Kong.",
    "203": "Edit: After the manufacturer replied to me they explained how to get the keyboard lighting set to a steady color, and how to adjust the brightness to my liking, or at least far closer than I was able to from watching videos about the keyboard. While it would be nice if clear information about how to adjust settings was either on or in the packaging so that people wouldn't have to go searching for it, this does make the keyboard far mor functional for my use, and I have therefore updated my rating to 4 stars from 2. Leaving old review below for reference.For the price it's not bad, but the fact that you can't select a single color and brightness for the backlighting to stay at is a great annoyance and makes the keyboard rather unusable long term in my opinion. I want to be able to see the keys, all the time, without having to focus on a new color or wait for the light to fade back in. I don't get the point of this \"feature\". The mouse is nice. Keyboard is otherwise perfectly functional.",

    "205": "I can't review all the features this keyboard has as I took it out of the box and without plugging it started typing on it. It's labeled as a quiet keyboard and it's not very quiet at all. The height of keys, while smaller than other keyboards I've seen are shorter, it still clacks a lot. I type pretty fast and this produced enough audible noise to register on my headset setting over on the far desk.",
    "206": "It is considered by the manufacturer to be an asset that the lights on the keyboard \"breathe.\"  This means that they dim to nothing and then light back up at a pace you can influence.  Adults however would like a solid color that can remain static, but this POS won't do that.  Ergonomically it is a good keyboard, but without stellar lighting I catch myself waiting for this stupid thing to light up if I'm looking at the keys for some reason.",
    "207": "This keyboard is comfortable and seems to be holding up well despite hours of gaming by both me and my children. Sturdier than the basic one I had picked up when we built my computer. Lights are kinda cool but really just appreciate the quality. Went with this brand based on price point and husband\u2019s experience with same brand. Don\u2019t know if it is exactly the same product as his but is very similar and the brand holds up. Also like the mouse features including the speed button and cloth covered cord. They don\u2019t seem to tangle as much as others do.",

    "209": "I built my first pc and spent a premium on parts to future-proof my rig as much as possible. However, this left little in the budget for peripherals. Luckily for $30, this Redragon keyboard and mouse combo was a good deal.Pros:-The keyboard is quiet and the RGB is nice. Many colors and settings to choose from.- I like the responsive of the mouse.-Mouse also lights up and has customizable buttons-Plugged both into usb slots and worked right away. No drivers or software necessaryCons:-The mouse can only emit red light. I keep my keyboard lighting at blue and wished my mouse could match.-When my pc is turned off, the mouse lights still turn on if I move it and remain on unless I unplug it from the usb slot. *Perhaps that\u2019s more of a usb issue, I\u2019ll test it in another slot later*.  The keyboard does not have this issue. -The keyboard\u2019s rubber feet are not glued to the stands very well. Both immediately fell off when I removed the keyboard from the box. Not much of a problem because I use a large gaming mouse pad. If you plan to use this on a slick surface like glass, the keyboard may slide during use- No packaging whatsoever during shipping. No unmarked box. No protection. The shipping label was attached directly to the Redragon box.Despite the cons, this combo is a good deal for those who are looking for a budget RGB keyboard and responsive mouse.",

    "213": "I have a fair amount of screen real estate that I use for video and soundtrack editing. I recently vastly improved my computer resources, MB, RAM, GPU and CPU (Threadripper), CAT 7 cabling, everything is bigger, better and faster, except my wireless mouse and keyboard. A decrease in accuracy, dependability and speed were slowing me down. I dusted off an old USB wired mouse and keyboard and viola, it was a little better. I like positive feedback from the keyboard. I also like back lit keyboards. I like stability in the mouse and great travel distance in small moves when needed. And, I like to feel the mouse, smooth is nice but texture is better. Quick button, short travel results are appreciated. And $$ need to be conserved. So, I took a chance on a \u201cgaming\u201d keyboard and mouse. No regrets with this Red Dragon S101-3 combo. Now after several hours of work, I could not be happier. Accuracy, speed, stability and tactile feedback are A plus. I very much appreciate the adjustable dpi.  The shortcut buttons are a nice, and welcome addition. The bonus is the bling in the variety of backlit options easily changed. Never thought I would care about that, but it is fun.",
    "214": "I have had this for several months now. This is not a perfect keyboard. However, for the price it is amazing. The only two cons I can think of are that 1) the plastic it's made of feels slightly cheap, but it has held up to daily use very well. 2)  When you shut down your computer, it forgets the color setting you put it on and defaults to rainbow mode. (putting the computer to sleep does not reset color selection) Changing the color settings are very simple, though, and it only takes me a second to get it back in my preferred mode. As for pros, the colors are bright but not too distracting. The keys have a satisfying action and feel very responsive. It has just the right amount of mechanical keyboard noise for me without being overly clicky-clacky.The mouse that comes with the keyboard is simple but solid. It only lights up in red, it's not RGB. However, I bought this keyboard set because I already had experience using this brand of mouse and wanted another one for my new pc. As a casual gamer, this set perfectly fills my needs and I will most likely buy it again.",

In images it still might look the top half bright enough but it is not actually during day time. and night time it is visible but clearly there is a difference that is noted.Good: Keypresses are soft, silent (except space bar while typing fast).Mouse is egronomically good, but point speed should be changeable with games or normal work.Overall good investment if half light keys are not a major concern.",
    "217": "For the price this is better than the popular brand has lasted alot of falls and spills and looks cool",
    "218": "In a short time using the keyboard and the mouse, I have fallen in love with the features and buttery smoothness of use.  I love the feel of the keys on the keyboard and makes typing a joy.  Smooth and the key travel has a nice feel for an assurance of the feedback click and clacking of the keys.  The mouse is so smooth and nice to move about the pages and tabs.  Also, has the buttons and keys with an assurance of accurate usage. I am not a gamer per se, but I love these types of devices to make my time on my computer enjoyable and very smooth. I have had other types of keyboards and mouses.  Wireless and with direct wire connections but never truly satisfied with the action and usage of the devices.  At times it would feel like a chore in engaging with the devices.  Making my typing assignments a nightmare in attempting to type what is needed in a timely manner.  I love my Redragon keyboard and mouse, for the price, it is a sound investment for the time spent on my computer to type out emails, reports, or my future best-selling novel.  Fantastic product and devices.",
    "219": "Overall, this is solid for the price. It is a multi-use PC, with some gaming and some work/other entertainment for my son, so I wanted full size with media keys in addition to the RGB backlight. He loves it. The lights look great in the dusk, night and dawn, but are a little dim for the middle of the day. The extra long braided cable for the mouse is excellent, as is the powdered finish on the mouse. It won't get slick in a sweaty palm during intense gaming! My one big complaint is that they made the plastic on the USB connectors so thick that the keyboard and mouse can't be plugged into adjacent USB ports on my motherboard. I may shave them down, but this seems like a serious design fail for a set that comes together. I have 2 usb 2.0 ports specifically for keyboard/mouse, but instead I have to use one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.2 for these...not good.",
    "220": "It's nice for the price I paid.",
    "221": "Ordered this keyboard and mouse combo because my old HP keyboard from 2002 finally perished due to a Diet Dr Pepper spill (RIP). Was surprised they shipped the keyboard with the label directly on the product box and not with a proper Amazon style box but oh well e____e I can't say much on the mouse that came with the set (I think it has adjustable dpi up to 3200 and has a few programmable buttons but doesn't have a finger rest so I avoided it) or instructions (hint: there were none lmao) HOWEVER, this is the best keyboard I've ever purchased at such a low pricepoint. The keys aren't loose and have a solid feel when you depress them and the rgb colours are vibrant and illuminate well. There are many different colours you can set the backlights to which is neat. The whole board is light but feels solid and not cheap by any means. If you're looking for an inexpensive replacement keyboard with anti-ghosting for casual use or even average gaming then this is it. Look no further. You have found a hidden gem without hype marketing overpricing it. :)",

Granted, I've had it all of a week, but so far, the mouse is SOLID and the keyboard, while light as a feather, feels solid as well .  The wrist rest area is essentially useless, but that's because it's solid hard plastic, rather than some gel configuration.  Both are recognized right away by my B450-Prime Plus motherboard and work without me doing a darn thing.  Getting it into \"breathing red\" mode is simple enough (follow the instructions and it works like a charm).Not sure how well it works for actual gaming, but as far as working in the office, it's been FANTASTIC!  I'll try to update in another month or so to see if this thing lasts.",
    "225": "For some, a gaming keyboard is an extension of their gamer handle. It also means that sometimes you will run into problems with products. In this case, let me just say up front that the mouse is great. I enjoy the mouse and it operates the way I expect a mouse to. However, let us talk a bit about the keyboard...this keyboard is crap. Let me explain, you see, when I got the package deal I was excited to get a new setup for my new laptop.However, when using the keyboard, I found that I had a defective product. Defective because the keyboard was no responsive. So, after several attempts, I decided to remove the keyboard due its unresponsive nature. The only thing that spared this product getting a lower review was that the mouse is great and its this package deals saving grace. Be cautious when ordering. Personally, after my experience with this keyboard, I will spend the extra money and get a keyboard by Logitech, Razer or one of the other big names in the gaming industry. Thanks.",

And he is SUPER rough with his electronics, so this speaks VOLUMES about the quality of this product. (I can\u2019t tell you how many headsets we have run through over the past 2 years.) Both devices still light up, and there have been no issues with functionality. All the keys on the keyboard are still in tact, no sticking, even the characters on the keys are still fully visible. My son complains about the keys being too loud during gameplay, but not much else. The mouse has full functionality as well - the scroll wheel still tracks, all buttons still work. I wish the mouse color could be changed, but that is just a personal preference. Excellent purchase!!!",

    "228": "This product is absolutely amazing!!! The keyboard feels amazing and works so well when I'm playing Guild Wars 2. The last keyboard I had would always stick whenever I was doing jumping puzzles, which is annoying especially when you are high up and a missed or over jump results in falling and, usually, instant death. And for some puzzles, this means restarting from the beginning, which is hard and often times extremely frustrating. If you are a gamer, then this is the keyboard for you.The mouse that comes with this set is also amazing. It is wired, which is better than the gaming mouse I had before this one was. (wireless rechargeable gaming mouse. Not sure why I even thought that was a good idea LOL). It is very responsible and while that buttons are loud, it isn't bad. I played a fractal last night with some of my guildmates and I had zero lose of mouse control, which was common with my old wireless mouse.All in all, this is a great set for the price I paid and I was not disappointed. I've already recommended it to another guildmate of mine so heres hoping he likes it too!!~High Priestess Starfire",

    "230": "I actually like this keyboard, wish it had a few more color option's, but it's an older keyboard. It feel good, has good weight to it, not sliding around. It's well made, been using it 6 month's now about. Heavy usage everyday about, and nothing's worn off. I like the mouse as well, only not the red light you can't change to match the keyboard, I just shut it off. The mouse is also well built, though the top buttons' fellt a bit flimsy and cheap, they are not, meaning they haven't broken after hundred's of hrs of gaming. The adjustable weights' in it are a nice touch. It fit's my hand very very well and I don't suffer wrist pain's trying to use it like other cheap mice, nor with the keyboard actually. It's a good older solid product overall. I'm sure the newer model's are better and improved upon, but go Red Dragon!!",
    "231": "I totally fell in love with this set, the keys are soft, the keys are not loud when you type, I also love the fact you can change the colors on this, it has perfect lights, its not too bright and not to low, its just right, the mouse always stays red breathing effect.. You can turn off the breathing effort, you can adjust lighting, you can adjust the speed of the breathing effect as well, the only down fall , which I don't mind, once you shut down your computer, the keyboard resets it self, when you turn on your keyboard back on the rainbow effect comes back on and you can switch it back the way you want it..  It comes with a manual which is a plus. But other then that, its a must have.",
    "232": "For the price, the RedDragon S101-3 is fine for general everyday use. The keys are responsive and the light patterns are easy to switch around. It is certainly an upgrade to your basic Dell/HP/Lenovo standard keyboard and mouse combo.The only gotchas that I am aware of are that the key letters do wear off with daily use. You also have to download their software to program in mouse macros. The software not as intuitive, but I was able to macro copy and paste on the mouse buttons for my job.",
    "233": "Not really one for extensive features in keyboards and mice. But this ticks all the usual boxes and I've had zero complaints so far.",
    "234": "Great product",
    "235": "This is exactly the kind of keyboard and mouse I was looking for. I'm not a fan of the taller keys on mechanical keyboards, so the lower keys are definitely a plus for me. The mouse works well and the RGB lights are easy to change at your leisure. Overall great product for the price.",
    "236": "Both the keyboard and the mouse are the perfect size and shape. I love the color patterns and options to change them on the keyboard. It is beautiful lighting up. The keys are spaced proportionately, and yes, some keyboards are not, making it super easy to use.The mouse is comfortable and fits perfectly into my hand. It has a grip texture that keeps your hand and fingers from slipping that isn't abrasive and doesn't irritate the skin.I like everything about them both. Neither feels cheap or easily breakable. The mouse is light enough that it moves smoothly, and the keyboard is heavy enough that it doesn't, both very helpful in gaming.Great design. Sturdy and durable feeling. Comfortable in all ways. Beautiful to look at. So far, I am very satisfied. I would highly recommend both for gaming and just everyday use.",
    "237": "Everything is great except the wheel, and even then only for clicking. I have big fingers and can\u2019t click the wheel without also clicking one of the regular mouse buttons. Other than that it\u2019s great.",
    "238": "Bought this package for the keyboard, as I wanted something that could be backlit.  I didn't really care about the mouse, but since it was part of the package, figured \"what the hell\"...The mouse would be nice, EXCEPT the driver software that controls all of its functionality does not work unless the mouse is plugged directly into the PC.  If you have a KVM switch, the driver software will refuse to start up.  If you try to get around this by temporarily plugging the mouse into the PC directly and configuring it with the driver software, those settings will be LOST once you disconnect it and plug it back into your KVM switch.This wouldn't be a dealbreaker, EXCEPT the mouse's default lighting mode is a throbbing red light, which is not suitable for some rooms (a bedroom, etc).  There's no way to turn it off unless you plug the mouse directly into the PC, and LEAVE IT permanently plugged into the PC.The keyboard seems fine, but many of the \"special functions\" (mute button, volume controls, etc) don't seem to work either (even after a reboot), which leaves me to wonder whether it needs to be plugged directly into the PC as well in order for ALL the functionality to work.Long story short, if you use a KVM switch, think long and hard about buying this package...  you might end up disappointed when you see all the features you DON'T get to use.",
    "239": "On paper this looked like almost an exact replacement for my dying Acer keyboard but once I connected it I discovered that just wasn't so.  It's manual mentions software but then, later, it doesn't use software.  You have to use two keys to adjust volume which is all wrong.  Their support is hard to get to because they have so many different permutations of the same (similar) item and one support address won't address the others.  I didn't need the mouse so it's sitting on a shelf.  I'm sure there are better choice out there.  I've just resigned myself to having to set the color to red every time I boot up!!!  Buy something else.",
    "240": "I originally purchased this for my husband, but his setup keeps him from using this product. I am now using it and I really like it. The keyboard is much quieter than the one I was using. It has some good weight to it and the buttons are easy to press. I really like the backlit RGB. It as quite a few settings to help anyone customize it to his or her liking. The keys have a matte feel to them which I really like. I hope in time the coating doesn't rub off. The mouse is a little to big for my fingers, but luckily my fingers don't have to be at the tip of the buttons for it to recognize the click. This is a personal problem. I have small hands and short fingers. I usually use compact mice because I use a claw grip. I cannot do that with this mouse because of the size. This would be perfect for someone with a larger size hand. I do love the dpi button and the weight customization. The mouse registers lighter pressure than other mice I use and I really like that. The top of the mouse is textured. That might be a problem for some, but I don't mind it. All in all I really like this combo and I think the quality is great for the price. I highly recommend this for casual gamers like myself.",

    "242": "In 30 years of computer gaming never once actually broken a key ?after only a few months the S key broke in half ?really ? what kind of flimsy plastic is this and how thin ? The coating wore off not only the S but the black as well. everyone of these keys is thin clear plastic with a wearable coating over time you will be blinded by the light coming off the keyboard. if the manufacturer is reviewing these reviews if you want to make this right simply mail me 4 sets of  W S D A keys as these are the high wear keys that get worn and I mean 4 sets as they wear out apparently 4 thousand $ faster then all other makes and brands I have owned in the past .. my logitech lasted 15 years i cant read those keys but they all work and not busted ..Followup.. when you first plug this in the RGB dances around in all colors bright and dim and so annoying you literally cannot stand it.... to make the colors stay on one color all the time you need to write down the steps and keep them handy because trying to figure out how to make the colors stop dancing and be solid can take up to an hour of pressing every combination under the sun.  going online is also useless as every tuturial out there doesnt have the info. not telling you the combo now because if you buy this you will need to suffer thru it till you learn to write it down or toss keyboard against the wall. (un plug first as pc is not the cause of this)",

With that said, this is such a great quality product for the price.I have been playing various counter-strike games for over a decade now. I wouldn't call myself great, but I can regularly maintain a positive kill-to-death ratio (I usually end up about 35 kills and 25 deaths on csgo). All of these years I have been using generic manufacturer mice and keyboard combos.I figured I'd \"splurge\" and bought this combo. What great decision. I wouldn't necessarily say it makes me a better FPS player, as I could do all the same thing on my generic components, it's just easier to maneuver now. That's it, really, it gets the job done at a nice price point. The keyboard keys are not too noisy when you press them and respond WAY better to key strokes than my generic keyboard(almost quicker feeling, maybe it's in my head). The mouse is contoured to fit my larger than average hand nicely. The instructions that come with it are clear and understandable. There are options to disable the windows key, change the dpi settings on the fly, and you can apparently press about 20 plus keys without the signals interfering. The red lights are cool, but I honestly would have no regrets buying this setup again without the lights installed.Buy it if you want a nice mouse and keyboard combo set. It's nothing fancy, but at less than 30.00 before tax, it's totally worth it.",
    "245": "The keyboard meets all my needs and some.  Typing is comfortable, color is nice, neon lights neat.  Used for research on line, entertainment and gaming.

    "246": "I spent days looking and comparing this product with other similar ones. I have never purchased Redragon products prior so I was a little skeptical.  I ended up going forward with it given the amount of positive reviews.The S101 is well worth the investment and it doesn't break the bank.  I actually like it so much that I bought a second set even thought I didn't need to replace our second computer's KB+M just yet.Keyboard - fresh looking; very quiet when using for work and gaming.Mouse - simple yet really comfortable when using for long hours.RGB - not too bright even when set to max in a totally dark room; very decent color selection for the price.Both sets I ordered worked right out of the box.  I highly recommend the S101 combo if you are like me where you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on other products that will end up disappointing you more yet you still want it to look good and work good.  Just buy it!",
    "247": "So, what do I like about this set? Not a SINGLE thing. The mouse began to malfunction within about 10 days, and proved to be worthless for regular PC use, and even more useless of low level games ( like those on POGO) so for it to be promoted as a \"gaming set\" is absurd. (unless annoying flashing lights equals good performance in the eyes of gamers) It doesn't track and clicking is fairly hit and miss. About 1/3 of the times when you click it does nothing, and the side buttons are hair trigger and they shut screens and change where you are at the lightest brush. As of the AM it is in a thousand pieces, because the only pleasure I have gotten out of this POS waste of plastic was stomping it into  oblivion after it closed out and lost a document when I brushed on of those side buttons with my thumb while trying to make the cursor move. If I could go punch the person who developed this POS in the mouth, I'd fly to China to do it. The keyboard is a whole 'nother thing...It is designed for people with very tiny hands apparently, and anyone with a sizable reach, who was trained on a typical/standard keyboard, will make constant typing mistakes...and honestly, the whole color thing is just freaking annoying, and you have to manually set it to the least annoying setting every time you restart your computer. Who needs that? Maybe a teenager who doesn't have anything real to accomplish on a computer, but not a normal human who has actual work to do. Beyond that, some keys you really have to strike fairly hard to make the keystroke register, other times if you brush the top of a button as you are moving around the keyboard to type, it will register that keystroke, so spelling mistake are an every single minute occurrence unless one types in the same manner as I was taught in High School typing class ( every keystroke performed with hands hovering about an inch over the keyboard, and my hands in full secretarial position.) I bought this POS set January 24, and today is April 27th, and I bought it because it had such high ratings for usability, and the price was decent...I wasn't expecting it to last more than a year or so, because that seems to be about the length of time and any keyboard and mouse will last these days, even with just average use. This POS lasted 3 months ( okay, I might have gotten another week out of it had I not taken the extreme pleasure of smashing the mouse...and the Keyboard is next as soon as I can shop in person for a new one that hopefully won't be yet another piece of crap) If it were possible to leave a negative rating for this crap set, I absolutely would.",

There seems to be slightly more keys as well, though I'm not sure what. I don't really know what people look for in keyboards to give a helpful review, uhhhh....the gaps are big enough to easily allow crumbs and cheeto dust to fall through, or be blown back out I suppose. I really like the lights and adjustable colors, brightness, and fluctuation patterns. Feels super sci fi and I just love that. The cord has a fabric covering with a velcro retainer strap that allows the wire to be shortened pretty easily, so that's kinda gankster. The mouse is okay. The buttons on it feel likd of wobbly and fragile, like it's made of very thin and inflexible plastic potato chips, but the two thumb buttons have a smooth one and a ridged one, allowing touch recognition.

I'm not a fan of downloading unsigned software from China, so that's a hard pass for me.Additionally, although it is a wired mouse, the leds on it are not powered via USB, but through batteries installed in the bottom of the mouse...

It's very hard for me to ship this back because i don't live in the US.Update 2: 2020-08-04I was able to pop the key out of the keyboard and reinsert it. There's a bit of resistance when I press on it now but it doesn't stick so far. I changed my star rating to a 3 since i resolved the issue and it's great that i can pop the keys out without breaking anything.",
    "254": "The feel and usability of the keyboard/mouse is stellar! I wanted a breathing backlit color changing keyboard and this delivers; HOWEVER, I cannot utilize the backlight as the slowest breathing color changing option still feels like I am being bombarded by strobe lights.It really is sad as I would give the keyboard 5 stars if it could slow to a nice blended, serene, and calm 5-ish second color change with a similar holding pattern before changing again, but alas, I will be storing it away as a backup keyboard once I can find an acceptable replacement since a ~.372 second color change is the slowest option...***UpdatedAfter reading reviews and playing with function keys, I found that this keyboard actually has a number of lighting and breathing settings not disclosed in the manual (or that initially worked). Upon pressing Fn+(Insert/Home/PageUp/Delete/End/PageDown) there are additional options to select from. I found several that is quite 'peaceful' and am now enjoying it!",
    "255": "This is my first gaming keyboard. I mainly got it for the colored wasd keys, windows key lock, and other features. Also although it isn't a mechanical keyboard it's hybrid membrane switches are actually very nice and pretty close to mechanical switches. I enjoy typing with it and it works well for gaming. I wish the multimedia controls didn't require simultaneously pressing of the F key but at least they're there. I was so mesmerized by the led illumination that I don't know when but one of the led lights in one of the lower panels went out. The panel still lights up because there are two in each panel so I don't really care. The seller offered to replace it but I don't really care enough because for the price I'm still very pleased with the keyboard the way it works now.They mouse is actually the best part of the combo. I was only wanting to replace my keyboard but having a mouse that matches is cool. The mouse is very light even with all the removable weights in it. It's very accurate and has enough features. And looks amazing in my opinion.Overall, the Redragon combo's quality far exceeds the selling price. After offering me a replacement for the led going out on the keyboard I declined and told them that I'd probably want to upgrade sooner or later to one of their mechanical keyboards. So in a nut shell, yes I'd buy from them again and highly recommend this product for anyone.",
    "256": "Mechanically both pieces of hardware work great, but I was unable to install the drivers and software to support them.  I contacted customer support who tried their best, but in the end they recommended returning the product to Amazon.  I decided to keep it as a backup, or to try again should we purchase a second PC.The PC is new, built by Newegg and delivered in March 2022, running Windows 11.  Not sure why the drivers wouldn't install.  So they are functional but without the supporting software you can't program keys, change the RGB colors, things like that.",
    "257": "I wasnt expecting a whole lot just due to the price point but I can honestly say this thing is great.While it doesnt have the total feel of a mechanical keyboard, I dont care lolThere will be the elitists that say if its not mechanical its useless, and they are wrong.Feels nice, the spacing is perfect, and the lighting choices are pretty alright.I wish LED purples actually looked purple and not pink, but im used to that by now.I didnt use the mouse it comes with as I have another Red Dragon mouse that is a few grades higher than this one, so this review is simply for the keyboard.If your gaming on a budget, or just want a cool looking keyboard, I would absolutely recommend this one as of now.We will see how well it holds up to light/moderate use.",

    "261": "This keyboard and mouse combo is actually pretty nice.  I really didn't need a mouse, especially since my old mouse was wireless.  But the mouse was so comfortable that I decided to use it.  The keyboard is nice.  The layout is a little smaller than I'm used to (old keyboard was a Logitech K520), but it's pretty smooth and I needed something that lit up because I'm working in a dark lit space.  It would be nice if they keyboard could be just a bit brighter.",
    "262": "I like the set up. The features are nice, and I don't mind the usb hookup. It's not the best I've used, but options are good to start out...",

    "264": "I replaced the low-profile keyboard and mouse that came with my computer, and this is leagues better for a low price. Mouse is responsive and adaptive, and the coated cable keeps it from snagging.You can turn off the keyboard lights with Function+Page Down, even before start-up is complete.",
    "265": "Keyboard is excellent. Good response from the keys, nice selection of multimedia quick keys. Don't care much for the colors but that's just me. Time will tell how the keys hold up. After a day's use, I can see that fingerprint and smudges will be a constant problem, so I left a cloth nearby to wipe things down after each use.The mouse is another story. It's just...meh. Maybe it's designed for a larger hand, but in mine it feels just a bit too long in that it doesn't sit comfortably in my hand and subconsciously I keep moving it because I don't feel I'm reaching the left and right buttons and the wheel properly. I'll most likely swap it out or go back to my Logitech mouse.So I basically paid $40 for a keyboard.Keyboard 4/5Mouse 2/5",
    "266": "Positives first, the lighting options are really nice, the keys and mouse have a good feel as well. Also the texture of the mouse is something I didn't think would matter but I really like that there's a bit of texture to grip it easier.My big problem is with the light in the mouse though. Every so often after shutting down my computer the mouse light will randomly decide to turn on. I've tried to figure out if there's something specific that makes it happen but it seems to be completely random so I can't fix it. With how it's going the light is going to go out so much quicker than the keyboard and it's made unplugging my laptop after a ts shut down more of a hassle",
    "267": "When I had a Windows 8.1/7 OS installed on my pc, I had a HyperX alloy origins core and wanting to change the color on it. And with this keyboard it does the trick in every which way without any additional software. Discluding the mouse because it only has one color, but real easy to drag-click on though",
    "268": "Every now and then i try a different keyboard to spice things up, and I am always disappointed in every keyboard that is not this one. I have tried all the fancy loud clickers, flashy lights, and boojie name brands and this bad boy red dragon still is the champ. There is no competition.... The only thing about it is you sometimes have to get physical with removing key caps for cleaning, but it just shows you the good build quality. No need to fear, the mouse is also amazing quality. Similar to the keyboard this thing seems like it should be 75 shamackaroos. After 2 years of working from home and gaming she is still good as new mechanically. A very small amount of the red paint has worn off from some sweaty gaming sessions but it adds character. Be warned, the only thing is the braided cord for the mouse may get tangled, but that comes with any braided corded mouse so no hate here. DONT BUY ANY OTHER KEYBOARD/MOUSE .....................",

The lights are a nice edition, though they do not seem to hold a memory unless the computer stays in sleep mode.

    "271": "Got this product a little over a month now and it is not acting right. It disconnects she still plugged into my PC and I have to pull both of them out and put them back in to gain functionality. Sometimes after doing so it does the same thing again after like 5 mins. I love it but that is my only problem.",
    "272": "Mainly got this mouse and keyboard for two reasons: low price combo and wanted to stick with my dragon theme.Keyboard: The texture feels kind cheap, but it isn't necessarily bad. I want to compare it to a truck's bed liner for texture. The shortcut function keys work surprisingly well. It was a little smaller than expected but that worked out for the better. The lights also are not too bright, it's just in the sweet spot for me. The spacebar kinda squeeks sometimes, but you only hear it if you're listening for it.Mouse: Weighted well. Love having a DPI button finally. Looks very cool, even without the lights on. Haven't used the extra thumb buttons in games yet, but they work in webpages so they are definitely functional. My only gripe (hence the 4 stars) is how the mouse wheel annoyingly will go the opposite way when you do a longer scroll. To elaborate, when you're skimming a website, scrolling down at average speed, it will go back up for one of the scrolls. It's only a little thing, but oh my lord it's annoying. Especially when you just need to scroll down one notch and it's like \"Nope, I'm gonna go up instead.\" Grr.Other than the mouse wheel, everything is working perfectly and not falling apart. Yay dragons!P.S. The Redragon mouse pad was bought separately and works very well also.",
    "273": "5/5 product with 2/5 instructions.  This is a great keyboard and mouse set if you can get over the fact that the instructions suck.  Customizable mouse weight is always a plus, however the instruction say very little about the mouse itself.  The mouse seems to be locked to only red breathing in color and the only readily available adjustment is the DPI. If color isn't important to you then this is a great set.  The keys are all very responsive and smooth.  The keyboard is easy to adjust.  The mouse features an anti-slip surface so your fingers won't slide although the opposite is true of the keyboard which is very slippery.  This is definitely one of the better sets I've owned but it's not perfect but for the price you can't go wrong.",
    "274": "Keyboard is pretty nice. The mouse is just a standard mouse. As someone who had their mouse and keyboard reckt by a mean ol cat knocking over drinks, it serves its purpose.The cat has not attempted to destroy the keyboard yet, so I assume he approves of the purchase as well.",
    "275": "I would have paid the full price of the bundle for the keyboard alone, it is by far the best keyboard I have ever owned. There are lots of different light options, the only complaint is that there is not different brightness modes. The keys are all very responsive and feel good to press. Very nice for typing and long gaming sessions because of the palm rest at the base of the keyboardThe mouse is not the best, you can't change the color of the mouse so it doesn't match anything unless your other lights are all red. The mouse itself is good build quality other than the scroller which feels a little loose to me. The customize-able weight is also nice. Also to make full use of the mouse (including the lighting and DPI settings) you have to go and download the software for it off Red Dragon's website. The wires on both the keyboard and mouse are very high quality. Will not wear out anytime soon. -1 star for mouse not being as nice as the keyboard.",
    "276": "for the cost this is an amazing keyboard/mouse combo. the mouse has several removable weights so you can get the feel you like, as well as lighting patterns [but only 1 color]. meanwhile the keyboard has several light modes and colors to choose from.the keyboard has a good feel and resistant level when pressing keys, but it is a membrane keyboard so it's doesn't have the satisfying clicking if that's your bag.i do wish it kept your presets every time you turned off the computer, but it is very easy to reset them every time you power on.overall, for the cost, this is an amazing RGB keyboard/mouse combo, but it is clearly not 'top tier', which would [and does] cost over $60 more....",
    "277": "I got this to replace a keyboard that had some water spilled on it, it seemed like a pretty decent alternative and the reviews seemed fine for the price point. The keyboard does what it's supposed to do and it's fairly comfortable to type on. I generally prefer membrane keys to mechanical keys since I tend to have auditory issues sometimes, so for a stripped down gaming keyboard it does its job well enough.I guess my problem is with the mouse. There wasn't any sort of software with the package and when I looked up the manufactures site the drivers assigned to the combo don't seem to do much, they tell me that the device needs to be connected (Which it is.) So I can't really program any of the buttons for any of my games or anything, which is... A little frustrating.Beyond that the mouse feels TERRIBLE in my hand, there's these like holes drilled into the side giving a rough texture where my thumb would usually rest, it makes me feel like I'm slowly grinding my thumb against the material.Just not a very well designed mouse at all.In short the keyboard is about what you would pay for and the mouse is pretty garbage overall. It's a cheap combo and I really can't be mad at anyone for buying cheap goods. I think I'm just gonna pick up a better mouse in a couple of weeks so it's not like it's going to ruin my life or anything, I just wish there were a little more thought put into the product as a whole.",
    "278": "Upgraded my old gear. This set is priced perfectly, looks awesome and works like a charm. Gave my old set up a fresh look.",
    "279": "I can still not believe the quality of this keyboard and mouse for the price. I am a light/intermediate PC gamer and it's response time is so much better than the standard apple keyboard and mouse setup. Here's the breakdown:Pros:-Keys are super springy. They have a nice feedback and bounce when pressed, with a lightweight feel while not feeling cheap-The lights on set is nice, but not overly distracting. Never had a keyboard/mouse with colored lights on them. Its a cool aesthetic but I could see if overdone it would be annoying.-(THIS IS A PRO FOR ME, MAYBE A CON FOR YOU) They keys are small. I have long, but thin fingers so many times the keys feel a little clunky in reach. Not on this bad boy. If you have mad meat hands though this thing will feel like a kids keyboard.Cons:-Mouse driver isn't mac compatible which just means I had to download a third party driver to set up hotkeys for my games. Not a huge deal and honestly still worth the price.Overall, if you are looking for a nice, quality, entry level gaming keyboard and mouse this is definitely the setup to go with. The more I use the things the more I friggen love them.EDIT: (12/31) So after a couple months using this set I can honestly say I still love the keyboard. The mouse on the other hand....well that has developed a bit of a latancy issue in part of the scroll wheel which is more than a bit annoying. I've taken a star off because of this (now its rated \"just ok\" at 3 stars.) Mostly, its the keyboard that is saving it since I haven't had any issues with it and its still as responsive as the day I received it. The mouse is going to need replacement. This time I will be careful to make sure its mac compatable so I can actually program the buttons without having to add 3rd party software.",
    "280": "This is the first keyboard I bought from RedDragon, and I'm not all that impressed.The Keyboard:- The backlight doesn't have any options other than a constant, not very smooth, rainbow scroll going from left to right. You can change the speed of this and nothing more.- Typing on the keyboard feels very clunky but has an odd softness about it that I kind of like. It reminds me of old school keyboards without the obnoxious clacking that they had.- The sound of this keyboard is very soft, and it's definitely for you if you're looking for a keyboard that won't wake up the entire household when you use it at 3AM.The Mouse:I actually like the mouse more than the keyboard itself. It's really smooth, and you can easily adjust the speed of the cursor through the mouse itself by pressing the small black arrow on the top of it. There is no RGB option for the mouse, but I'm fine with that, seeing as it is a nice red glow.Overall:The keyboard is definitely not something I'm super stoked about, but the mouse is really nice.",

The keyboard lights up in 7 singles colors at once (Not bright), Then it will show it 7 separate colors off choice including white. Just press \"FN\"  and \"HOME\" Keys at the SAME TIME to change colors. What I hate about this product is your can see the spacing in-between the lettering which can be confusing to find the letters to type. Wire to keyboard is made poor quality, expect it to break down quickly, especially if your a gamer. It plugs into your USP Port with ease. I would recommend this to friends & family until you find something better.",
    "284": "So, I've had this set for aprox. 6 months now. Before now, I've had no problems, but as of the last week or so the mouse wheel has been acting up. It feels as though the rubber has expanded or loosened from the internal part for the wheel, so I just spin it with no results. I have to press down hard for it to catch, to the point where I actually press the center mouse button. This is no big problem unless you, like me, play competitive games online, where that extra second of having to fix up the mouse wheel to, say, switch a weapon or equipment of some kind, can cost you your life or even team victory. I am sure that there is an easy fix to this, which I will likely try to find. If I can, I will return and give it the 5 stars it deserves.Edit: I have searched for help fixing it, but it doesn't look like there is any readily found.I am still having the problem, but it seems to be increasing more frequently. It is beginning to become almost unusable. If anyone has any information or can refer me to a video that could help, I would be Very grateful. I may still have some time left on my warrantee, so I'll look into it.",

The RedDragon keyboard was just as responsive and comfortable to use, the mouse was functional for work, the dps obviously isn't as high as a $150 gaming mouse, but it was still very responsive and comfortable to use. I just wish finding the proper brand name software to bind buttons was easier to locate and use. It is a true plug and play that doesn't download anything when you use it like razer or Alienware.",
    "286": "It has all the features advertises, and is pretty sturdy.  Easy to clean.  My only problem is that I could never get the software to customize my mouse to work, though that isn't included with the product and is instead installed from the RedDragon website.",
    "287": "I use this duo every day for work. The keyboard is great, but I wish the lighting was more consistent. It tends to fade on and off while I'm typing, so sometimes when I need a certain character and need to find it on the dark keyboard, that can be frustrating if the keys aren't lit well. The mouse drains quickly and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. I have to turn off the mouse every night and I need to recharge it 2-3 times per week. The keyboard will stay charged for 2-3 weeks without needing a charge. I use the items 9-10 hours every weekday in my home office.",
    "288": "Amazing keyboard and mouse combo, quiet smooth, the lights are bright and add some flare,  highly recommend",
    "289": "The keyboard and mouse are alright, they do just what they're supposed to by typing and clicking. The lights on the keyboard are fairly easy to change and nothing is out of place. I will agree with some  comments that the wrist rest is awkward, it's just long enough to hit the palm of your hand but too short to rest on it.My biggest complaint is that the software downloads are non-existent or difficult to find. If you search S101-3, there are no software downloads. I eventually found that the mouse is actually a M601-3 Centrophorus Mouse and downloading the software for that will allow you to customize the keys, record macros, etc. I haven't done much with that, I did try to map the side buttons to skip songs and it didn't work. If you find the keyboard, the software doesn't recognize the keyboard at all. The closes I could find was the K503 RGB LED keyboard.The other issue is when power is shut off, the lights revert to the \"demo mode\" and the mouse sensitivity reverts to the slowest speed, so that whenever you restart your computer you have to reset these. It wouldn't be such a big deal, but the keyboard goes into a flashing light show that's just annoying.If I had to do it again, I would probably get a different one. I'll use this one until it gives out since it works as a keyboard and mouse.",

When I wake the PC up out of sleep mode the keyboard essentially shuts down for about 3 minutes.  I contacted the manufacturer (Redragon) and they were no help at all.  Since they didn't sell it to me they suggested I contact the seller about the warranty.  I didn't buy the warranty and now that I'm beyond 90 days with it I guess I'm stuck with a faulty keyboard.I recommend buying this from Redragon directly.

I\u2019ll take part of the fall on this because on one part of the description it does say the mouse is just red lit. The upper part of the description where I stopped reading says this is an RGB mouse when it clearly isn\u2019t.EDITSeller contacted me to clarify the packaging issue come from amazon and apparently you need to select an option to have amazon package it.

As of the time of writing this review I have been using both for about 2 weeks and can say that I think it is a good product for the price. The lighting on the keyboard and mouse is not that bright which for me is perfectly fine. The only issues I have with this product is that the keyboard lighting effect you pick goes away after shutting down your pc. This means every time you turn on your pc you will have to put the lighting effect again which is not hard but it is annoying.

I spent a long time trying to find the drivers and then figuring out how to open the file.  The mouse is a M106 but that's not what it says on the back of the mouse. The lights on the keyboard are not very bright. There are several different colors but you can not choose one color and keep it, it has to scroll through all 7 colors. my keyboard had a manual but my mouse did not and directions are very basic and generic. Keep in mind a young person will have no problem but if your somewhat older you will struggle a bit.",

Personal favorite is the rainbow wave effect, complements the mouse as well. But sadly I dont know if the mouse changes colors instead of one color.Speaking of the mouse, fresh out the plastic, it moved smoothly. It's like tech p*rn for me tbh. Love the dip settings as well.

I got a new PC for Christmas that came with a keyboard I hated so I did some research to replace it and decided on this one. I use it for work and gaming and I love it for both. The keys are grippy, easy to push, and just the right height. The mouse is just ok for me. I have small hands and I think it would be better suited for someone with larger hands. Overall I would recommend.",

    "303": "Great keyboard for the price, more than i expected. Typing is very comfortable and the product is well built. It's nice that you can change backlit options from the keyboard itself but i would like to have some software as well because there is no option to adjust every key separately. Overall i am very pleased.As for the mouse, i am a little disappointed. Firstly, it is ridiculously heavy, i removed all of the weight pieces and it's still noticeably heavier than my previous mouse. Probably because the mouse isn't small at all, anything larger would be too large. People with large hands will like it though.Secondly, it lacks accuracy for a gaming mouse. Adjusting dpi both with and without software (the software is quite good but unfortunately it should be on all the time like MSI Afterburner) gave me headache, it is always either too fast, too slow or both at the same time!Probably, i had too high expectations from a low budget product because my previous mouse was just perfect which i got a long time ago for like 10$.So, 5 stars for the keyboard + 3.5 stars for the mouse = 4 stars for the combo.",

I am moving into the gaming and editing industry and this keyboard and mouse helps me move significantly faster and more accurate than my last setup. The commands to change the colors are easily memorable so you don't have to have the manual nearby. My only dislikes is that the left shift key feels a little tough to push down with your pinky when you are gaming but granted I am not an avid gamer and it is a minor issue and another dislike is that the mouse does not change colors and it is only set to radiate the color red which kinda of puts the idea of my ideal setup.

So all of the special keys on top of the number keys only the lower half of the special keys stand out in the dark.. But it was a cheap KB/Mouse...

Although I'm not much of a gamer I always wanted one.Pros:Keyboard- good quality materials- quiet mechanical keys- dedicated media keys- plug and play- various lighting modes to select fromMouse- good quality materials- very comfortable design for carpal tunnel- long braided cord- textured for better gripCons: USB connectors are a little bulky where if you plug both cables side by side it can bend the connectors.Keyboard- dim rgb lighting hard to see even with lights off- easily prone to fingerprints even after washing, drying hands and using no lotion- no dedicated volume keys for fast access to turn volume up/downMouse- easily prone to fingerprints",
    "310": "My main gripe is with the description of this product... Limited keyboard support on Mac. Okay... No harm n foul... Likely just means the windows key is now the command key. What the description misses is that there is ZERO software support for the mouse on Mac. I now have a mouse with two macro buttons that are completely useless on my computer. I know the title says Windows gaming, but the lack of support on Mac should really be highlighted a bit better.Small update: So on their website they claim if you set up your settings on a PC before moving to a Mac your settings carry over. That\u2019s actually not true. The software is 100% needed for the settings and it won\u2019t run on a Mac.Also, the macro buttons on the mouse have a pretty extreme lag when pressing repeatedly. I have a Corsair mouse at work with undo set to one button. I can press it repeatedly and it instantly resets the process. With the mouse from this post, if I press more than once in 10 seconds or so it won\u2019t do my macro but the one time.",
    "311": "I have a mechanical keyboard I was using at work.  My co-workers have been getting annoyed by how loud the keys are.  At the recommendation of a friend, I got this keyboard and mouse set.  This keyboard is virtually silent without the keys becoming \"mushy.\"  Allows me to type quickly and comfortably without bothering my coworkers.  The mouse travels smoothly, the scroll wheel is comfortable, and it has back and forward buttons for easy navigation.  Both the keyboard and mouse make a wonderful candidate for a \"just get it done\" keyboard and mouse.  Does its job and stays out of your way.  Wonderful keyboard for work.",
    "312": "I bought the keyboard for my first pc build and I like it. It's not mechanical and as a membrane keyboard, it's been serving me well. There are many options for the lights and they add a nice touch to the keyboard. The one problem I have is that the fast forward button gets lodged when I press it and doesn't come back up. This ends up skipping a ton of songs when I press it. Luckily, I was able to pluck it back up, but the button is basically useless. Otherwise, the keyboard works great.",
    "313": "If I would have saw the package deal with the headphones I would have got that one. This keyboard does everything in the guy in the video makes it do. very easy to change light patterns.When working in a dark room this is the Ultimate piece of equipment!",

    "315": "Hey I wanted to say that I love the price point of this Product it feels very durable and the mouse is sensitive . My only pet peeve is you can't change the Color of the mouse . Ive only had it a day so if anyone out there knows how to do that Id love it but Other then that for office work this is a Home run love the fact that the Keyboard is back lit and the keys have the right responsiveness . The Mouse changing color isn't too big of a deal but it would have been nice to have that option",
    "316": "Lighted Keyboard changing colors, nice responsive keys, easy setup",

    "318": "I bought this as a replacement for my last keyboard after I spilt chocolate milk all over it and then destroyed it trying to clean said chocolate milk. So, you know, based on my track record my knowledge of keyboards is questionable- but what isn't questionable is how nice this keyboard is! Lights are very pretty and everything feels nice. It's not as loud as my last keyboard, which is a bummer since I have to find a different way to block out the intrusive knowledge that we're living in a simulation and will be consumed by the very capitalist greed that facilitated this purchase, but y'know at least I can use my computer again. :)",
    "319": "The positives first I guess; The keyboard is amazing for typing, gaming, or any need for the keyboard, and same for the mouse. Great clicks and texture to the mouse in my opinion, soft grittyness like... 160 or 200 grit sandpaper? Doesn't feel like it chaffs like literal sandpaper, but I like rougher surfaces for my hands for grip. Mouse gliding, again, another thing pretty smooth. My specific issue is the product representation which is the rainbow effect on the keyboard. It's disappointingly faded on certain parts of the keyboard. The top, for instance (F keys), are lit up, but the color is hardly there. I know this may be more of an affordable breathing color KBM, but nevertheless I must be honest about one of the interesting themes of the Keyboard. Everything else though, simply amazing.",
    "320": "I recently purchased this keyboard to go along with my Dell laptop & docking station.  This is a cost-friendly alternative if you are looking for a glowy-gaming style keyboard, but don't want to drop a bunch of money on a Razer.  I already use a Razer gaming mouse and Tartarus gamepad, so I wanted something that would have a similar glowing effect.  While I stuck with the Razer mouse for my laptop, we hooked the Redragon mouse up to the other computer and it has a nice feel to it as well.  The keys on the keyboard have a nice touch sensitivity and aren't super clicky-sounding.  Would definitely buy again!",
    "321": "changing the rating to 1 star from 3 because keyboard no longer works.  it's going to trash bin.  I bought this Sept 29, 2021 so i got less than 3 months of usage before it completely died.It's a good value keyboard and mouse combo but after 2 months of use, the membrane under the \"Enter key\" became overly sensitive and it keeps pressing the enter key without even being touched.  To clarify, whenever I hit keys near the enter key, the slight bend in the keyboard engages the enter key.  I am not even putting pressure on the keys and It does this even when I am so delicately pressing the keys. This is major flaw and I have hard time unlocking my pc because whenever I am entering the passcode the enter key interrupts and presses itself in the middle of the passcode.  At first, I thought I was hacked but after switching out the keyboard the problem went away.  To further test this theory I pressed underneath the keyboard where the enter key is located and amazingly enter key was pressed.  Not from the top but from the bottom of the keyboard!  I now hit the enter key really hard to create some separation between the membrane and the plastic bottom and this seems to work for now.Also, I was so used to having PC sleep button on my previous Logitech keyboard and not having this function on this keyboard is bit of a inconvenience.  The mouse works perfectly and very precise.  It feels and weighs just right.  Lighting on the keyboard and mouse is fire. I really wanted to like this keyboard but this enter key issue I am having is a deal breaker and I would not recommend this product.  I am past the return period and stuck with this. If I had known how flimsy the plastic case was I would not have bought this product.",
    "322": "For the price, it seems to be a good value.  It delivers as advertised, there is nothing I have found that I  would rate poorly.  A couple of nitpicky features could be improved and most likely are on more expensive models.Mainly, I would like the light on the keys to be brighter and I have used Red Dragon's wired mouse for years and have loved them for both function and awesome design.  I wish the keyboard had a similar appearance.  The logo not being lit is a little disappointing but this too may be due to the price point which may not be really worth it.  Overall I would recommend it for those who like: Quiet, fast Responding, smooth action, and comfortable keys with a solid built keyboard.",
    "323": "After Abusing this keyboard and mouse with hardcore gaming, I can say that it's Overall a good buy. There are some things to note for the Nerdy Peeps out there. (I just bought this order again)-The Keyboard's rubber backing under the keys is one large piece across the entire board. In other words, you will not easily be able to replace a key membrane with another one.- The mouse is good. However, the first to go, over time, was the mouse wheel (Which was just terrible from the start), and then the primary and secondary keys. Surprisingly, the side keys on the mouse held out very well despite me using them quite often to voice chat and use a melee punch feature in Overwatch. (A Game)- The Mouse and Keyboard have high durable cords and attachments . Simply amazing.- Overall, for the price, This Mouse and Keyboard is outstanding. I just wish I could replace the key rubber pieces in the keyboard... So, I gave it 4/5 stars.",
    "324": "Nice keyboard. I needed a keyboard that I can plug into my computer for power because the wireless keyboard kept dying. I only use it for work and not gaming. The colorful lights blink. I'm not really sure how to turn off the blinking lights, but haven't really looked into it since it doesn't bother me.",
    "325": "It's plug and play for Macs, at least as of the most current 10.15.7 (19H1715). Don't bother downloading the manufacturer's software, it won't work anyway.Once plugged in, just press and hold the FN key and then click around the keys labeled LM. Keyboard can be just a single color constantly on. The mouse does NOT change colors, it's just red.Good luck!",
    "326": "I like this keyboard a lot, however after only having it for about a MONTH, the white letters on the black keys are starting to rub off. I usually don't have to look at the keys, but when I do, I have to turn a light on sometimes. I like to save electricity and I actually don't have nearby light on my PC... I'm used to the monitor glow lighting things up enough.Also, I do NOT like the unusual shape/size of the Enter button. I keep hitting BACKSLASH because it's where most enter buttons are on keyboards and then i hit enter because it's in the wrong place (for me). This is a real irritant to me, being a long time computer user and part-time programmer of 10+ years, I use the backslash a lot.For the price and functionality, it's DEFINITELY worth the price, however, knowing what I know about the irritants, I would have forked out a bit more. I might end up getting a set of keyboard stickers, but I did that once and they just rubbed off too.Overall, satisfied I got this when I needed it, because I needed one bad. Kind of wish I didn't get the 2nd one at the same time! LOL",
    "327": "This keyboard works amazing. The keys on this guy are very comfortable. The back lighting features are a great touch. I leave it on rainbow with the blue led over my wsad which works great for me. The lighting isn't distracting. Except for the moving one and the breathing one, those are pretty terrible. All keys worked out of the box. Very smooth feeling and comfortable to use as well.The mouse.... I ended up buying a Logitech cordless G602 that I use instead. When I did use the mouse that came in the bundle it was ok. Felt pretty cheap, very light, decent response. All the buttons worked it just felt like it was gonna break in my hand. It seems like they had a really nice keyboard and they threw in a cheap 4 dollar mouse to make it a bundle. Also the mouse only has red Led breathing lights.I use the setup for drafting and light gaming. I love the keyboard and have gotten lots of compliments but the mouse is meh. I recommend pretty much any Logitech mouse but the one I've found most reliable, versatile, and affordable is the Logitech G602.",
    "328": "It's a great buy. I got it once I started playing Valorant and it is extremely helpful. However I wish the colors were brighter and there where more of a variety to choose from but the colors are still beautiful.",
    "329": "The keyboard and the mouse looked great for the price. The mouse died about a week later. The price didn't warrant a lot of my time so I got my old mouse out and I am using it.  I bought the set so I could see my keyboard bedroom with the lights out so my wife could sleep. I guess you get what you pay for.",
    "330": "4 stars because it's a ~30$ bundle, and you're not getting 5star mouse AND keyboard for 30that being said I actually rather like the mouse quite a bitthe keyboard is good enough, no lag, input is comfortable enough.The material is very lightweight, the mouse is quite reactive and matches my hand perfectly, again it's not a 200$ mouse but what it is  is miles above the quality of other 30$ packs you'd get at walmart or target from logitech etc etcif you're poor this will do you well, if you're just in need of a hold over this will do great, and if you're looking for some slick badass BoXxEr/Faker machine, then you're not spending enoughalso based on price and comfort, and the excessive amount of usage, travel, and frankly gamer ragleslams I've put on this equipment it's pretty reliable and cheap, consider it for offices too if your boss got those shitty ibm tiny keyboardsoverall it's good enough for me til i can afford some bougie thing",
    "331": "Love it for the price. Key travel is excellent. The only two minor complaints I have are: 1) the mouse can't change color and kind of pulses red and 2) there are volume keys but they are built into the f-keys so they aren't a one-key press. You have to hold function down while hitting F2-F3-F4 depending on what you want to do. My old keyboard had dedicated keys for this and it was nice.Overall, great value for the money. We ended up with two (birthday present mix-up) and my son ending up keeping the second one since he liked it as well. Very cool lighting, easy to control.",
    "332": "Only issue I have is that while the keyboard can change colors the mouse cannot. It is always red. So unless you want your setup to be mismatched colors the keyboard has to be red aswell. Seems odd to allow for a variety of colors on the keyboard but pair it with a red only mouse.",
    "333": "I'm liking this keyboards back-lit display. The mouse is nice too. The keyboard is lit up like a Christmas tree and I don't have to turn on lights to use the keyboard again.",

At first I thought it may have been some initial friction on the plastic which would go away after a few hours of use, but here we are 3 days later and the noise does not appear to be going away (see attached video). I am going to attempt to exchange my mouse and keyboard for a new set in the hopes that I may get a new one that does not have this same issue. If and when I get a replacement I may revisit this review... but for the time being, this mouse in unusable in its current state.UPDATE (new review: 4 stars):I was able to receive a replacement Keyboard and Mouse from Challenger USA, and am happy to report the new mouse does NOT squeak like the old one did. It did, however, take over 2 weeks from the time in which I sent it back to receiving a new one. None the less, I am updating my review to 4 stars based on the new unit.",
    "335": "So I have used this keyboard for around 6 months now, and it seems to be working fine. I remember the keys being mushy on the first day, but they are fine as of now. Only problem is some of the bigger keys like  shift and space are really inconsistent with how they feel to type with. The rgb is great for working at night. However, one issue with the rgb is the keyboard software wouldn't detect the keyboard in my case, so customization was limited. The mouse software did work though, and all mouse buttons are able to be remapped. Another cool feature is drain holes on the bottom of the keyboard in case something spills on it. The mouse also has a nice braided cable. Speaking of the mouse, the clicks and two extra buttons are really clicky and satisfying. The dpi button in the center really helps with increasing the sensitivity on the fly. Generally, good value considering the price.",
    "336": "This a wonderful keyboard and mouse combo! I bought on black friday and have been happy ever since. The keyboard has very quiet keys, an easy to use light-changing system (\"FN\" key and either \"insert\", \"Home\", or \"Page Up\") and it feels good too. The mouse has a good tack feel to it and it is a joy to use, although it doesn't have the weight of a typical gaming mouse. My only disappointment came from the lack of color-changing options on the mouse, unless I am bad at looking. Red is just not the color theme I chose, but it is great for fans of red. I recommend!",
    "337": "UPDATE: Changed to 1 star, wish I could select 0 stars. 1 star seems unfairly high. The mouse is unbearable. It regularly stops connecting to the computer for a fraction of a second which makes it impossible to use for gaming or most tasks. The mouse pointer itself will wiggle and move around on the screen in large arcs even without me touching the mouse or desk. Luckily I got a refund for it and I will be throwing these items in the trash. This was a huge waste of time and effort and I urge anyone reading this to choose a different brand.I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. The keys for the keyboard are very gummy feeling and don't seem very pleasant to type on. Not only that, but some of the keys are extremely unresponsive. I have to smash the shift key in order to get it to respond. I also bought it thinking that it came with keyboard software to reprogram keys and macros, which it does not. Also, I was very excited to have the colors on the keys and utilize the cool effects, but all of the effects are really loud. Like, when I put it on \"breathing\" mode I hear a reasonably loud electrical whine when it is cycling from on to off, to the point where I only use a solid color because it's so jarring to my ears.As for the mouse, it is okay. The thumb buttons are really far forward for how I hold the mouse but I think they would work for other people. The texture on the mouse is very pleasant and I like the ability to add/remove weights. As for the responsiveness though, I bought a wired gaming mouse thinking it was going to be more responsive but it is not. It is pretty unresponsive and seems to drift a lot. There have been a lot of times where I am not even touching the mouse and the on-screen cursor is wiggling back and forth and drifting around.All in all I would recommend getting something else.Will it work? Yea.Am I happy with the purchase? Absolutely not.The product also arrived over a week late, which isn't the manufacturer's fault but I feel it necessary to include in the review.",
    "338": "Since these items are bundled together, I'll rate them together. Both products are fully functional and are a step up from the basic $20 Logitech equipment I was using before. The red LEDs are also nice, since red doesn't make my room uncomfortably bright while sleeping.The mouse has good sensitivity and a nice texture in my hand (something I didn't notice advertised, but am pleased with). It'd be nice if I could make it a bit heavier, but the weight isn't bad. The mouse wheel is firm and only makes noise if I spin it very quickly. If I were rating just the mouse, I'd give it a 5.The keyboard is the weak part of this deal. It looks nice, and it functions as it should, but the key presses are just too squishy. Compared to my old Logitech, it's hard (when in a frantic game) to tell if the buttons are fully depressed. It's worked so far, it just feels off. The placement of the function key also bothers me, as the right Windows key is the one I actually use. It's a decent keyboard, but by itself it'd probably be a 3. I will likely replace it with something higher quality in the future.",
    "339": "For normal use, this keyboard is great. Responsive and comfortable for longer writing sessions.For gaming, it\u2019s good but not great. No indents from home position on keys can lead to misplacement of fingers in quick situations, like FPS\u2019.The mouse is responsive and has speed settings. However, I\u2019ve found the backlight does not shut off.The keyboard lighting is by far one of my favorite aesthetics of this unit. Several themes for backlighting and easy to use and set what\u2019s most comfortable and visually appealing.All in all, great bang for the buck in most situations."
