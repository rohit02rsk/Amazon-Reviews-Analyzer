B09P7ZK4CJ,"Update: sometimes there will be very notable smear when moving objects in games. It's not always the case, but it's annoying whenever it appears. The situation didn't replicate itself on the original screen of my laptop, so I'll assume it's the monitor's fault.=======================================================So I bought two of these monitors to build a dual monitor setup. Long story short, as monitors, they work not badly so far, in the standard of a non-professional user. The picture was blurry at first, but then I noticed that I simply forgot to remove the plastic film on it.They worked just as great as my old ASUS monitor, or I guess so. My old one's been broken for a long time and I can't really compare them anyway. I connected one monitor with HDMI and another with a mini DP port. The mini DP-connected monitor seems to support 165 HZ, which I have no idea whether it's because individual product differences or because I connected with DP instead of HDMI.There are no major issues so far, but there are minor flaws. Not the quality, but the design. First of all, this monitor does not have a built-in speaker, instead, it has a headphone jack. This is no big issue to me since I usually prefer my headphone, but just in case you're building your own PC, you might want separate speakers. It does automatically become your default audio device and is sometimes annoying, but I guess it's not really *this* monitor's issue, but rather a general problem.The second issue is that, remember I said there's plastic film attached to the monitor when it arrives? when you remove it, the bottom of the film is... clamped on the bottom of the monitor. So when the film is removed, you will get a sheet of film that is flat on three sides, but the last side is torn in a jagged shape. Uh, I guess nobody would ever care about this?The third issue, the monitor is kinda thin. Besides the center bottom, this is a thin and big monitor. It's cool when you put it on your table, but my dual monitor setup is installed on a monitor mount. Each time I adjust the angle, I'm worried about damaging it. Not a big deal if you're using the stand included in the package.",More than I would expect,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2023",True,4.0
B09P7ZK4CJ,"I really liked this monitor, high refresh rate, DP for my GPU, the only downsides I've noticed thus far is that:1. it comes default with a really dark contrast2. when I use it for extended periods of time it starts to ""flicker"" like the brightness is constantly adjusting itself3. the feet are really low on the back of the monitor meaning that the arm mount is also low, so its way out of line with my other monitor4. the buttons are less intuitive than they could be, they're put on the back in a straight line and not labeled very clearly so adjusting picture quality and color etc. is a little challenging to people who don't know which button is wereall in all great monitor would definitely buy again, but for a first time monitor I'd definitely recommend a different more versatile one",good quality and gaming performance,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023",True,4.0
B09P7ZK4CJ,"OverviewNice graphics (1440p) and refresh rate (up to 144Hz with included HDMI) for a $180 27"" curved monitor. I was skeptical because similar monitors cost around $250, but in spite of this monitor's quirks, I still think it's a good deal.Bugs encounteredThe screen flickers non-stop when both FreeSync is on and I switch out of a full screen game. Not a problem when FreeSync is off.When I leave my connected laptop on lock screen and return after several minutes, the monitor will flicker with a black screen persistently. Solved by putting my laptop on sleep mode instead.ConclusionI'm just an average gamer and YouTube watcher, so this monitor meets my needs and the screen looks great. Will consider upgrading to a 32"" curved monitor from a more reputable brand eventually, but for now this is more than satisfactory.",Nice but Buggy,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2023",True,4.0

One thing that I've noticed is that white text on a dark background will occasionally have significant chromatic aberration, the way to fix this is by turning freesync on then off again in the monitor settings, also make sure your ClearType settings are correct in windows.

B09P7ZK4CJ,"Starting with the monitor itself, it's nice. I got my first one during the Black Friday Sale for a pretty good price. Once I got it hooked up with my gaming laptop, it certainly was relatively smooth. After being satisfied with it, I ordered a second one for the good old dual-display feature. But the first monitor I ordered had an awful bug where you could see annoying lines around the screen's surface. It was a different model since it had an extra USB port in the back compared to my first order. So I returned it. After getting the replacement today, I can see the new one is the same model with fewer bugs.I know it's different from the adapter since I tried both old and new screens with a cheaper and more expensive one twice. And there can't be any severe visual issues since my gaming laptop is perfect.I don't know. But what I can say overall about this product is that it's a very good Black Friday deal. It has extremely great Hz and visuals but lacks compatibility with other screens. I'm not planning on returning the newer screen just because the bugs aren't as bad. But I'll probably buy some better screens eventually.","Pretty good monitor, small bugs","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023",True,4.0

B09P7ZK4CJ,"Classic example of you get what you pay for. The image isn't too bad. You have to cycle through mods to find which one works best and adjust settings. Even at 165hz, this has some bad mouse ghosting. I use this primarily for work. The only time I notice the mouse ghosting is on dark backgrounds, Spotify for example. The stand is the only part that truly bugs me. I'm just typing and it wobbles around. It is not a good design, it is not stable. I'm a little concerned this thing is gonna break one day from how much it moves. So if you game with this, and hit your desk, you're in for it.

     I needed a new gaming monitor since the one I’ve had for the past 3 years fell over and cracked. I contacted the manufacturer to purchase a screen replacement from them but they didn’t not offer any screen replacements for sale. So the hunt for a new monitor began. I initially planned on a 2k but decided to first settle for something a step up from 1080p but not exactly 2k so I went with this 1440p that I came across while browsing online. Have to say I struggled with it at first because many of the settings were grayed out and I couldn’t make any picture adjustments due to that. Turns out I had to shut off HDR mode which honestly was the best choice. I got this monitor just to play some games on my new PS5. (Had to replace the old PS5 because it gave out and Sony wouldn’t replace it unless I admitted to damaging it which I did not, it was a faulty console) and once I figured out how to properly work all of the setting’s, I fell in love with it. The picture quality as well as vibrant colors are beautiful. I’m running up to 120 FPS on games that support 120 for the PS5 at 1440p and I’m impressed. If a 1440p at 120FPS looks this great, then I can hardly wait and see what a 2k from this company looks like. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a good yet inexpensive monitor. Also, I want to point out that the customer service I received was absolutely phenomenal and some of the best I have ever received from any company. Thank you for all the support Lacie! 🤗",Love it!

B09P7ZK4CJ,"I purchased this monitor for the purpose of checking out a VA LCD, 1800  curved display panel. This is the first time I have used this type of monitor. I am very satisfied with the picture quality. This monitor is excellent for watching movies and good enough for office work even though it is only has 1080 resolution. I find that the 27 Inch curved panel is less of a strain on your vision than a flat panel.  I am not aware of any distortion due to the curve. This monitor is well suited to general purpose use. The only complaint I have about the monitor I received is that at the time I ordered the monitor, the specification described it featured HDMI and DisplayPort. However, the item I received had HDMI and VGA. If I had seen the VGA specification I probably would NOT have ordered this monitor. I noticed that, as of today, the posted specification does show HDMI / VGA but at a discounted price, which is still a good value.

B09P7ZK4CJ,"I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this monitor is. I just bought a gaming PC and wanted to get a larger monitor (the smaller one Ive used for work didn’t have the best picture) but I didn’t have the money to get the type of higher end monitor I wanted. Decided to give this brand a try as I was looking for a curved monitor that was more budget friendly.The picture is solid, and I like that I didn’t have to do a lot of adjustments out of the box to make the picture work for me (and not destroy my retinas, lower brightness is my friend).I don’t really know how to describe it in technical terms, but my only negative that I can think of is to me this monitor isn’t as “vibrant” as I’d like. Compared to my TV, the screen is a little dull? It’s very hard to describe, because I do think the image quality is quite good (very impressed with it on the games I play, and it’s perfect for work), but I think it’s maybe the backlighting that’s not as bold as I’d like it to be? I do not think it detracts from the performance of the monitor, it just doesn’t pop as much as I’d like.I’m very happy with this monitor, took a gamble on a brand I was not familiar with and I’m quite impressed.

It doesnt support 165hz on everything but for my desktop it only supported 165hz. The stand for the monitor kind of sucks, i might have gotten a faulty one but it never snapped in place and the monitor itself almost fell the first time i stood it up on its own, leading me to have to put tape behind it which ruins the look if you look from the back.

If you are used to great quality 4K screens maybe pay a little more but for what I need this screen for is perfect within the quality however…. I am extremely upset and feel very displeased that they state this is a 27 inch screen when in fact it is not. I personally measured it and it’s actually 24 inches. Knowing that this is a curved screen I measured the curved front and back and it always concluded to 24 inches idk if there was a mis print or maybe I was sent the wrong screen but it is in fact a 24in. I personally feel if they are going to state that it is 27 it should stay true to that sale pitch if not please charge me the correct price please.

B09P7ZK4CJ,"I could not ask for any more, this monitor actually surprised me a lot, I assumed this was a generic brand or just a cheap false advertising monitor. But no it was the exact opposite I get the package and it was humongous compared to my smaller one ,Even though it isn't 4k and 165hz it's still a great monitor with 1080p, this is great for a stand alone Xbox or playstation, it was also really good for the price, I would definitely recommend this as a gift or new monitor for your setup",Really great monitor for starting out on gaming!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 23, 2022",True,5.0
