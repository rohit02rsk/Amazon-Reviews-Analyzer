B09RB9Z4Z2,"I purchased the GE67 HX with the OLED panel back in early December 2022 but I wanted to use it for at least two months before writing my review. I'm happy to say the laptop has been solid from the start. It's especially great for gaming, given the OLED panel's 240hz refresh rate and super low response times. I bought the MSI to replace my 2019 Razer Blade 15, also with an OLED panel but with slower refresh rate because 2019. I went with MSI this time because it was a good deal and also I wanted a thicker laptop with more room for cooling. Sure the fans get loud during gaming but the performance is absolutely top notch in fast fps games and this MSI averages temps that are quite a bit cooler on average (I monitor these with Throttlestop and Afterburner) than my 2019 super thin Razer Blade 15. I use both on a laptop stands while gaming for the best airflow. If the fans are too loud for you, MSI also allows you to set custom fan profiles in MSI center so you can adjust based on your preferences. Overall this MSI is a solid choice for the gamer or person who wants a portable workstation PC.",Powerful laptop with the best screen (240hz OLED 1ms) for gaming.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 17, 2023",True,5.0

B09RB9Z4Z2,"Saw so many video reviews on Youtube before buying; the main gripes were the screen isn't bright enough, and the fans are too loud.Reports of <400 nits brightness are WRONG.  This unit is rated at and delivers 600 nits, with 500 nits being the industry average, its above.  There is (was) a bug with MSI True Color washing out the HDR, but there is (was) a fix that is well documented by MSI.  I fixed mine in minutes.  HDR content is awesome and dynamic, and the OLED screen is just intoxicating.  You won't want to look at an LED screen again.To address the fan loudness issue, unless you are playing a AAA game with ultra settings, this will not be an issue.  Chances are you will have an external sound source or headphones, so it won't matter anyway.Leading into this: The only small gripe I have with this laptop is that the built in speakers are not very loud at all.  They are usable and sound fine, but you will want to get your sound from somewhere else when it is convenient.Otherwise, this thing crushes games and is a great machine all around, and I cannot say enough how amazing the 120Hz OLED screen is for gaming.  It is so smooth.  I don't want to play at 60Hz ever again!Without going to the super-expensive range of laptop out there, this one is a deal for under $2500.

B09RB9Z4Z2,Everything was fine got what it described just to let you know I had to uninstall the display driver and install it again along mith msi true color since the screen was looking almost white compared to my desktop screen. But once you do that it is great! Very good actually! playing games in ultra and getting over 150 fps. Just have to make sure you update all the drivers and graphics drivers. The fan noise is noticible but it maintains good temps. Highly recommend. If I get any issue I will update the review.,Very good.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 22, 2023",True,5.0

     There is basically nothing wrong with this laptop. The only drawback is that it is super hot!!! I'm afraid it will explode!

B09RB9Z4Z2,"This is one of two laptops that currently have a 1440P 240Hz oled monitor. The other is $1500+ more expensive.It’s an absolute monster in games and in benchmarks. It’s literally the fastest 3070 Ti on the market, mainly due to it being 150w and able to cool it.The RGB in front is nice. Not too bright or in the way.The CPU is unlocked and with a little bit of tweaking you can undervolt to increase battery runtime, which isn’t great.

Fan noise can be a little loud but there are options to lessen that. The speakers aren't the best and headphones might be a good choice, but they get the job done for casual gaming sessions. I downloaded the updates for everything and initially I had the infamous color fade issue, however I discovered that you can actually go into MSI True Color which is an app pre-installed and manually just change the colors back to vibrant and BOOM all fixed meaning no craziness involving reinstalling graphics drivers.

B09RB9Z4Z2,"It games over 100 fps in most games. The mux switch keeps the keyboard super cool. It’s a pain to set up but that’s the trade off with a fully customizable system. I have both the ram and gpu over clocked 50hz and runs as smooth as butter. The keyboard and the mystic light looks great. I like the keyboard and it’s big font and buttons even if the travel is short and mouse pad is great if you speed up the in mouse settings.  If your thinking for college or travel, the brick it comes with is a bit ridiculous and is definitely a pain to lug around. That is the biggest minus besides the battery but no 12 gen intel machine seems to be great at battery life. The screen is smooth as butter and I play Halo at 150fps avg.

     as of right now all I can say is this machine is a beast. I do have to admit I did not except for so many of the drivers to be so out of date for something so new. I would recommend to update everything as soon as you receive the laptop. MSI Center was giving me some issues where Mystic Light would not open up, all it took was an update to resolve the issue. Also the RGB Light bar on the bottom is SteelSeries brand and will not show up under MSI Center. You will need to get SteelSeries GG client.

B09RB9Z4Z2,"This is the most honest review of this product you will find. I bought this in August via another channel. Short version is its been back to MSI twice, the problems persist and I have spent countless hours trying to solve them.As a qualifier - I was upgrading from a MSI GE66SFS I bought in 2022 that has worked perfectly since day one. I have gone back to that model. MSI's customer support has been very good and I am reviewing just this product. I was able to identify 2 problems that were deal breakers for me:1. I was unable to ever get wireless headphones to work in any game without static to the point it was unusable. I would end up having to plug into the 3.5mm jack with my Arctis Pro Wireless. I bought both Nova Pro Wireless and Razer Blackshark Pro Wireless with the same results. Bluetooth also had the same results. This was true with the dongle directly connected directly to the laptop. I removed the laptop and tested at other locations to rule out outside RF interference. Seems like a hardware issue. Outside of games it was fine.2. I work from home as an IT professional and Cybersecurity Expert. I use a KVM. This model ships with a Steelseries keyboard. Using any KVM (I tested 4 different models all purchased new with the same results) causes the usb to completely fail. My keyboard is a Steelseries Apex Pro TKL. I used a Razer Basilisk mouse and the afore mentioned headphones. Again, outside of games was fine. Connecting the KVM and just the keyboard causes a failure.What I would say is its specific to this model. My older GE66 has none of these issues. It worked fine with my KVM with audio passing through it in the exact same setup in the exact same environment. I could literally plug this one in to the same setup and have the issues described, swap for the GE66 and have no issues at all. I thought maybe it was related to win 11 (The GE66 has win 10). I rolled it back to Win 10, installed the drivers and had the exact same issues.For MSIs part, they serviced it twice, replacing the motherboard the second time. The issues persisted. The first time they were responsive, the second not as much until I got a good tech who believed me. Overall I would buy another MSI based on their service and my GE66 experience, and this model is amazing if you don't plan on using wireless or a KVM. The OLED screen is amazing and I really wanted to like it. I would recommend sticking with a new GE66 (or GP66) over this if you want MSI.Maybe it's just mine. Not everyone will use it in the way I do. For me it was a desktop replacement I could grab and go when needed.
