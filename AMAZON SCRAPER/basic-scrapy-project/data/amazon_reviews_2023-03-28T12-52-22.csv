B09VCR969M,"Not a huge gamer but I'm sort of picky with my mouse feel and size. I tried a few different mice and my previous main mouse was the Glorious Model D, both wired and wireless. It's been a great mouse but I found the wireless version battery doesn't last more than a day and it's been ""wired"" almost full time. Started to be frustrated with all of the cables on my desk and tried to find another wireless that fit my hand but also wasn't super heavy, low latency and had good battery life.From the reviews, the top gaming mouse was the Logitech G Pro X, very expensive but I wanted the lowest latency possible. While the performance of the Pro X was great, the body feel was very cheap and almost like a plastic Easter Eggshell. The body also felt too slick and combined with the extreme lightweight just didn't vibe with me.For work I have a Razer v1 Viper wired, it's good but the buttons feel slightly mushy, so I didn't check Razer for a gaming replacement at first. Later I ended up buying a Razer v1 Viper wireless, and looks like they fixed the buttons, they were very snappy and the latency of the wireless was almost the same as the wired. After such a positive experience, I was going to buy another v1 but with the news of the v2 coming out I held out.From the first out-of-the-box experience with the v2 Viper, I first noticed they removed the dock and there's no longer any quick charge ability. Honesly, this isn't a big deal, if you need to charge the mouse, just plug it in, and use it. With the dock, it's sitting on the stand, taking up space. The mouse is now USB-C which is nice, comes with the same very flexible cable, and the wireless dongle has a nice extender where you can have sitting as close to the mouse as possible (reduces latency).What's the biggest change on the mouse? It's very noticeable of the weight reduction, it's about 12g of difference, but at 58g, it still feels very solid (much better over the Pro X). The body of the mouse is the same as the other Vipers, it's slightly rough but doesn't feel cheap, fitment is great in my medium hand. It is worth noting Razer had to remove a few features of the v1 Viper in order to reduce weight.One thing is it's a solid black mouse, I love the new look. The only indication of any LED's is a very small dot right below the mouse wheel, this indicates the battery charge. There's no other LED's on the mouse so keep that in mind if you're looking for matching the keyboard. Another change is the removable of the right side ""thumb buttons"". The v1 Viper allows for right and left-handed use, but the v2 Viper only has the buttons on the left side (for the right handed user). A nice bonus is the included grips (four pieces, two side stickers, two for the buttons), these are very grippy type of rubber.While I haven't owned the v2 Viper wireless long, it has great latency on the wireless side and with the light weight doesn't feel any more than my wired mice. The pricing is a bit steep but it's on par with other high end gaming mice, I would choose this over the other brands based on the Razer fits my hand the best and has the best click feel.Downsides? The biggest issue is the auto-installer for the Razer software. I'm sure the software is not too bad but having the prompt every time is frustrating. I often use a Razer mouse for my work laptop and given the security issues, prefer to not see this app auto-execute.",Same feel as the v1 but lighter and less extras,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on May 11, 2022",True,5.0
B09VCR969M,"I previously used the Razer Viper Ultimate as my main FPS gaming mouse (especially in CS:GO) and have quite a few of them lying around. I love the shape, and prefer it to the Logitech G Pro Wireless shape. I feel like it works much better for my grip (palm/claw hybrid) and hand size (19x10cm). When I saw this mouse come out, I was excited to try it, but still happy with my RVU so I waited a bit for the price to drop. I eventually got it for a great price from an Amazon Warehouse deal and I'm so happy that I did. The build quality is top-notch. All of the buttons feel great. I have no squeaking/creaking/flexing/rattling, etc. The mouse feet glide effortlessly. The reduction in weight also made a huge difference. I can much more easily perform quick flicks, especially 180 degree maneuvers when needed. The lack of RGB means you are going to get much better battery life than the older Viper Ultimate (unless you turned the RGB off). The only minor gripes I have are that it does not support my old Razer charging dock, and I wish it had a power switch rather than a power button, so I don't have to wait a few seconds for it to power off/on. This is still an insanely good mouse. Highly recommended.",Incredible mouse!,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on January 13, 2023",True,5.0
B09VCR969M,"I loved that it's such a fast mouse and it really does weigh 58 grams(It comes with not-yet applied grip tape; if you add it the mouse weighs slightly more)! Be aware that the first time you use it you will probably have to use it wired. And unlike people whose USB dongle came broken, mine works fine!

B09VCR969M,"The box seals were open but the protective sticker on the bottom of the mouse wasnâ€™t. Wouldn't be surprised if someone bought it, didnâ€™t like how it felt in the hand, and just returned it. Saved me some money though!As for the mouse, coming from a Razer Mamba Elite itâ€™s definitely so much lighter. Clicks are light but a little loud. Tuned it out after a couple days though so it doesnâ€™t bother me.",Bought Renewed. Probably new,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 17, 2023",True,5.0
B09VCR969M,"After the half a year I had with the mouse, it's a fantastic mouse. My only issue with it is the USB Adapter Dongle; suddenly stopped working. I thought it was the USB port went bad, and I tried in all other ports. I then connected my Razer Deathadder I use for work and found my USB port still works. I believe the only way that you can this issue fixed is getting it RMA and a entirely new Mouse. I've read that other users have ran into the same problem. So if you do buy this mouse be forewarned and maybe get the hyperpolling dongle.",Only one issue with the mouse: the USB adapter dongle,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on January 9, 2023",True,4.0
B09VCR969M,I decided to give Razer a try after my G Pro X Superlight developed double click issues. The Razer Viper V2 pro is a great replacement and performs as well if not better in every regard. My only gripes with this mouse are the lack of wireless/magnetic charging and the battery life in 4kHz mode (around 24 hrs vs over a week).,Excellent Replacement for G Pro X Superlight,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 20, 2023",True,5.0
B09VCR969M,"6 months of heavy use (9-12 hours a day and lots of gaming) mouse holds well. There is no deterioration in click feel quality or stability of the main button panels, which was issue with previous generation of full sized Viper family mice. Battery life is around 30% longer comparatively to RVU (with RGB off).Mouse has great skates out of the box with no need for aftermarket ones. Plastic holds well so far, and rubber grips are very useful addition.","Second to none techwise, good build quality at lightweight design with no holes.","Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 12, 2023",True,5.0
