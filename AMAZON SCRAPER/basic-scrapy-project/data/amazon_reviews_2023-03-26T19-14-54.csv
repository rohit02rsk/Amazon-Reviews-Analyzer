B0BHC395WW,"Short review!I'm not going to review the Amazon selection or delivery process. I'm just going to briefly review about why I upgraded to a PS5!First the negative....... my PRO was compact and reasonably designed in a flat symmetrical style......  The PS5 throws out the space saving rule book in favor of waves and advanced looking style and it'll not fit where your PS4 PRO was if it was in a tight space.Be aware that although the PS4 and PS4 PRO had 4K HDMI output for games, those PS4 models were limited to playing only 1080 Blu-Ray or regular definition DVDs.  The PS4 will not play 4K Blu-Ray disks. Why Sony left that feature out, who knows!  The good news is the PS5 DVD deck plays 4K movies to their full resolution. (as well of course as Blu-Ray 1080 and lower resolution/standard def DVDs). Now I only need my PS5 in the living room to cover it all rather then the 4K blu-ray player I had to use along with my PS4 PRO.I own several PS4 games and have yet to purchase any PS5 games.Let me say that my PS4 games play better on the PS5 then they did on the PS4 PRO. Graphics are superior, speed to access any menu or just in game play is much faster and these PS4 games take on a new and improved view on screen on my 65"" 4K hdtv!I can only imagine how great games specifically designed for the PS5 will be to view and play.My initial perspective on the PS5 compared to my PS4 PRO is that although the body design for the PS5 sacrifices space and fit for cosmetics...... the PS5 blows away my PS4 PRO (my PS4 PRO is using an upgraded 2 TB SSD for more capacity and much faster access/read speed than a spinning hard drive).....Speaking of SSDs and upgrades; the PS4 used the common SATA 2.5"" internal SSD for upgrading capacity and speed. (But) The PS5 has a soldered in ~860GB internal SSD which can not be removed. Sony added one slot for expanding the hard drive capacity using rather a plug-in PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD over a conventional SATA connected hard drive. Thus, the PS5 allows you to not replace the original hard drive, but, to add an additional on-board SSD instead.Typically, the soldered-in or card type SSDs are a bit faster then using a SATA based protocol connection and given the PS5 requires a very fast solid state hard drive, they designed it so you install an additional PCIe type SSD over replacing just the single hard drive as it was done in the PS4.Be advised that (some) PS5 games take 2-3X more capacity then a PS4 game did. Perhaps why Sony designed the PS5 to add more capacity by using a second expansion slot rather then like the PS4 just having only one slot to use for the total capacity.Google PS5 SSD upgrades and there's much info out there regarding how many games you want to be able to store on the console and how large an upgrade you need to do accordingly!Everything on the PS5 is faster........everything......menu, access, games ...graphics are better in detail, clarity.......I could go on.The other thing the PS5 asks you to do when you first set it up is a complete setup for display for best gamma, brightness, contrast, color, etc......it takes you through a complete and easy set up to -maximize- the quality for display on your HDTV. It made a huge difference on my Samsung 65 inch 4K TV.5 Stars all around! Read the pro AND owner/user reviews on this new PS console. Yes, it is worth upgrading.The ps5 is a totally new and better gaming console. It's the first to be backward compatible with PS4 games, ...something my PS4 PRO would not allow for my PS3 games. So if you have a PS4 game collection, don't get rid of them!If you own a PS3, PS4 or PS4 PRO, yes, it is a worthwhile upgrade and substantial evolution for the PS Game Console series. You will not be sorry for upgrading and a big upgrade it will be!","A major step up from a PS4 PRO (and previously, PS3)......faster and better graphics....","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 25, 2022",True,5.0
B0BHC395WW,"I love the console. It is gorgeous and quiet and the controller is wonderful and it is everything I wanted it to be. I didn’t even realize you could install another SSD to expand storage until I read the manual so that was just icing on the cake for me. This might be the first PlayStation console with an HDD/SSD that I don’t fill up within a year or so and I love that. Not to mention if you install the SSD then it doesn’t have the limitations that an external one would have so great job Sony for offering good options. The ordering process was abysmal.No real information about when/if you’ll get the invite, no details about whether there will be a console without the game bundle available, no way to switch your preference after the fact. Seems intentionally set up to be unnecessarily difficult. In fact if you just look at Sony’s website you realize there is no shortage of these, you can buy one at any point direct from Sony with no issue and no waiting and no invite, so this is an Amazon problem. I don’t think I’ll buy any consoles or actually any games from Amazon anymore. This and their preorder failures have made me consider other options. GameStop and Walmart and other places don’t seem to have the same issues.",Love this console,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 17, 2023",True,5.0
B0BHC395WW,"I bought several games for the new PS5 and they work fine. At first, I thought Ragnarok GOW might be the best game I ever played, but bugs and glitches began to occur with increasing frequency. The severe cases involved main story ( so you cannot avoid the issue) villains that continuously and immediately respawn after I (my main character) have defeated them. For example, on one occasion I defeated two easy attackers and a 3rd very difficult one only to turn around and the very same 3 attackers jumped me again...and again...etc. I did escape and just avoided that confrontation, only to later encounter the ""Flame Phantom"" ( difficult to beat ) and, once again, I moved my character a few feet and out he jumped again! In tracking one of the dragons, I beat 2 trolls (protecting the path to the dragon showdown) possessed by 2 pixie-type villains (Nokkens) and, as I left the arena, I could hear a Nokken resume his chant and atroll growling again--I returned to fight again, only the pixie was frozen in place and invulnerable and the troll proceeded to bash my brains out at leisure...so, I cannot beat the troll(s) and cannot fight the dragon.In ALL these cases, I tried reloading checkpoints, restarting the console, reloading earlier saves, to no avail. Today, I tried pursuing the adventure with one of the other main characters (Atreus) but he got stuck with Thor in a dead-end ice tunnel that is supposed to open up when you point a mask object at it, but does not open up...meanwhile, villains continuously jump out of the ground and walls and proceed to bash my brains out.I prefer games that give me a fighting chance not get my brains bashed out.I am attempting a new download (which takes hours) and will try again. It's too bad...turned out to be so disappointing. If the new download changes things, I will update this post.UPDATE2 days after I wrote the above, an update downloaded to my game when I opened it. I am v happy to say that the update resolved ALL the issues I had, so I changed my rating from 2 to 5...definitely the best game I have ever played!N","PS5 is good, the video game had bugs but thry were fixed!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 23, 2023",True,5.0
B0BHC395WW,"My in laws ""bought"" my kid a PS5 a couple years ago, by which I mean they said ""here's the money, I don't know where to find one."" And, it turned out, neither did I...at least not at regular price. Eventually we sort of stopped looking. So imagine my surprise browsing Amazon idly at like 9 PM to see this bundle advertised with overnight delivery. I jumped on it, and less than 12 hours later it was sitting at my door.Setup was easy and intuitive (and the system really holds your hand the whole way through). Performance is a notable leap forward from the PS4, and they system is relatively handsome despite being significantly bigger than I expected.At some point I'll replace my own aging PS4, and I want to dig in to the remote play via PS4 aspect, but initial impressions are all great.",Actually available!

B0BHC395WW,I had purchased 3 of these one for each son and paid anywhere from 499.99 to 1240.00 and my middle son wanted one for his room so he purchased 1 also. Out of the 3 purchased from Amazon only one has had a problem. In the end it had to be returned to Sony and we received a new one. Something with the power had nothing at all happen and it had just been sitting hardly used at all. But as a last resort I have purchased asurion warranties as last resort. Went through outside supplier and Amazon and it was past warranty time so contacted Sony and it was still under the warranty for them. I have always purchased this warranty because I have it on my cellphones and have had to use it. Everyone was professional and responded in a timely manner. So far happy customer and hope to remain that way.,Christmas presents,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 6, 2023",True,5.0
B0BHC395WW,The Dual Sense controller with haptic feedback is worth the price of admission.  (I do with the games used the controller speaker more though).  The sense of immersion is incredible however.  Well worth the money to upgrade from my ps4.  I got the disc edition and was thrilled to learn that many of my favorite old disc games came with a free ps5 upgrade!  A Thiefs End included a free PS5 version of The Lost Legacy.  With the push of a button I was able to transfer any digital games from my ps4 to ps5.  Most do not include the haptic feed back just better graphics.  The Last of Us Part 1 was my ps5 splurge.  I paid for the new version and it was awesome.  Especially the navigational hints option.,Worthy Upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 8, 2023",True,5.0
B0BHC395WW,"The unit/box is huge and aesthetically unappealing. That makes it difficult to place on and around your entertainment center, particularly if your setup is in a room that sees a lot of guests. More frustrating is that the curvature makes the unit awkward to place. The circular stand doesn’t have a secured attachment point when in horizontal mode, and I’ve already had it slip off while trying to access the back panel USB ports. Lastly, the curved top means you have to be incredibly careful even temporarily placing objects on top, such as the CD case or PS5 controller while load a disc into the system.System OS and controller ergos continue to be superior to those of the Xbox line. I have not played anything on either the Xbox Series X or PS5 that could not have been played without complaint on the previous generation consoles. We’re what? 1? 2? years into these releases, and while load times are clearly faster, I find myself playing significantly more PS4 titles (ports) than games truly made for PS5, and the same is true for Xbox, so my recommendation as of January 2023 is chill on trying to get your hands on these new gen consoles. At the moment, their appeal is more of a mirage than real - like bragging rights that you were finally able to get one.FWIW, my assessment of the games is based on gameplay using a 77” LG C2 OLED with HDMI 2.1 and a 7.1 ch surround system powered by a Denon AVR-930H. I certainly have the hardware to take advantage of next gen console gaming, but as I said, there’s nothing to play that makes the experience palpably better than previous gen consoles…yet. So still no rush to buy this thing. I would try to hold off until SONY releases a slim version, hopefully in early 2024. Good luck. Have fun.edit: unlike Xbox, games cannot be played directly from external drives, so while you can download and store them on a USB drive, you still have to manually copy games onto the internal drive, which also means having to decide what to remove to make room for the new game. it’s unnecessarily inconvenient in my opinion, but it’s typical of sony and nintendo who are both more guarded and restrictive than microsoft.",terrible ergonomics otherwise solid new console,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 13, 2023",True,4.0
B0BHC395WW,"Yes - I gave it 4 stars, Why? I'm not sure - because it's more of a 3 - 31/2.To start; it's bulky, awkard shaped, and not impressive.I have a PS4 Star Wars edition (comes with more storage and more USB ports) sure its a special edition and that should be expected from an older model PS4, but better than a PS5?  unfortunately.. yesI use an external HD for extra storage, but I'm also using a VR (1st edition) headset which (with the VR connector to USB adaptor) takes the available USB port - no external HD.The plus - PS5 games are better (period).So I decide to purchase the VR2, and its sleaker and not as constraint as VR1 - it also uses the USB-c port opening the other USB ports for other choices.  Unfortunately, dont expect to use those PS4-VR games (not compatible).To conclude, sure the games are better, but how much better? - not much, and (in hindsight) if I was alerted about the PS5 avaialblity I wouldn't take it.",mmeehh - take it or leave it,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 9, 2023",True,4.0
B0BHC395WW,This is the first next-gen console i buy so I when do I start. First it comes with a preloaded game. Astro's Playroom that is fun. the you have the code for God of War Ragnarok that actually gives you the PS4 and PS5 digital versions the only thing that I did not like about the console is that the controller battery does not last long. Is like 2 to 3 hours when the Dualshock 4 lasted about 5 to 6.

B0BHC395WW,"I was kind of apprehensive about getting one because of the reviews I read about people getting “used” PS5’s or ones that broke within hours of play. The negative reviews always stand out.PS5 is well worth it for me. I am very happy with mine and am glad I got one. I got the Ragnarok Edition and I did read that it is a DIGITAL version not a disc copy. Don’t know why people leave bad reviews because of this. READ the description I guess. I have almost a month of play on mine and it’s running great. I immediately got upgrades for mine. Camo plates with better ventilation, cooling fans (highly recommend this no matter how long you play for), and LED lights.The first thing I noticed is how fast things load up. From the time you turn it on- your actually playing your loaded game in less than 45 seconds. Plus updates and initial game loads - none of them have been over 20 minutes. I remember PS4 days where game updates and initial load times took HOURS!!! So much so that I always knew I’d be playing the game either the next day or later in the day if things were kicked off in the morning.Graphics are a massive improvement. Even for remastered PS4 games.The controller improvements are substantially better too. The new haptics are much better.Overall PS5 is a major improvement over PS4. Glad I got one.",Worth it.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 3, 2023",True,5.0
