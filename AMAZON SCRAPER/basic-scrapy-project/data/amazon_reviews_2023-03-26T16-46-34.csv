B07ZSFXPZX,"This is a really nice machine. Smaller than I thought it was going to be, but that's because the screen has a really small bezel. It didn't come with a USB-C converter, but they only cost a couple of bucks. I don't know why people give this 1 star because it doesn't have the ports they expected - maybe they didn't read the description?? Screen is high quality. I thought a higher resolution would be nice, but for 13"" the standard HD is fine. It's extremely light, which is what I wanted. Battery life seems great, but time will tell as I add programs. The price was right, and I liked the support options available on Amazon as opposed to the ones on Dell's site.",Great little laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2021",True,5.0

B07ZSFXPZX,"I got the laptop and it was perfect. The eighth size, good quality, and working as expecting. Within a couple months though, the screen crapped out. Laptop turns on but displays a black screen. From what I’ve gathered this requires a new motherboard or a new touch screen, both requiring money out of pocket. I’ve had laptops run years without issues, so pretty disappointed in this problem considering I’ve only had it a few months.",Great but short lived… ran into issues,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",True,3.0
B07ZSFXPZX,"Unfortunately, if you encounter any issue where you depend on Dell's support you are out of luck.  Dell will waste your time with incompetent Indian technical support.  Their system is to toss you around between technicians until your call gets disconnected and then you have to start the process again.If you run into any issues your best bet is to search for a solution online.",Nice hardware,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2021",True,3.0

B07ZSFXPZX,"I only purchased this laptop in Sept. 2021 and since receiving it has completely shut down at least once a month. Calling Dell support the first time, I felt more like I had reached a scam artist telling me that I had to pay in person for a technician to come my home. I have done everything explained online thru Dell's web site to get it up and running again each time, but none of the suggestions have worked. It has eventually started back up after completely letting battery die, then recharging.  RIDICULOUS! Once again, it has shut down, but this time completely. No lights at all showing any connection. Not charging back up or anything. A total waste of almost $900!! NO MORE DELL PRODUCTS FOR ME.. EVER! This laptop is a piece of trash. Adding.. it really sucks that after trying to trust it was just doing a monthly reboot, then then it died completely, the laptop is not returnable. I am making note of this seller and will not purchase anything from again. Having a year warranty on it means nothing!!",Unreliable,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022",True,1.0
B07ZSFXPZX,"I bought it to replace my sister's laptop, I'm not usually at home so when it arrived I couldn't check it myself, from day 1 she experienced random reboots and I blamed it on partial windows or driver updates. Because of the pandemic, I couldn't travel for months but when I did, y completely updated the system (BIOS, OS, drivers, etc.) and the problem persisted.Read tons of forums but none of them had something new for me to try, so I guess it had to be a hardware problem, but to my unpleasant surprise, my warranty has expired. This is the first time something like this happens to me, even with the invoice they told me there's nothing to do other than buying an extended warranty, so I also tried it, but after multiple request directly to Dell, I gave up...Just don't let this happen to you, support from Dell is non existent and the seller ""J&R Mega Store"" probably sent me an used computer as brand new.",Mostly useless laptop and probably a shady seller...,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021",True,1.0
B07ZSFXPZX,This laptop was a absolute disappointment!!! My daughter got this for graduation and was excited to use it for college. She started the set up and the screen turned black and we could not get it to turn back on. We looked up troubleshooting of the problem online and found tons of a people with the exact same problem who got no help from Dell Customer Service.  We contacted dell and they went through the same things we found online that did not work! Then they asked if we had an external monitor to connect our laptop to to see if that could help find the problem? When we said we don’t have an external monitor they hung up on us. So basically the gift my daughter wanted most was awful and didn’t work.,DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL LAPTOP!!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2021",True,1.0
B07ZSFXPZX,"The computer packaging did NOT include a USB-C to USB adapter. Reviews and Q&As on Amazon stated the this adapter is included. So frustrating because I needed to retrieve files from an external hard drive which is USB but could not because there are no regular USB ports.  Now I have to order an adapter from Amazon, Dell, or go to Best Buy.  My wireless USB mouse does not fit so off I go to buy a USB-C mouse. Same with external hard drives and USB thumb drives.  It seems the USB 3.0 and lower ports were removed so the laptop could be thinner and sleeker.  Now it just looks foolish with adapters and dongles everywhere.  Not to mention the money grab for all the new USB-C peripheries.  Just leaves a sour taste after spending $1000, now having to buy odd fitting adapters to get my data from my USB 3.0 drives.","No regular USB ports...only the small USB-C ports which require an adapter, not included","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2020",True,1.0

B07ZSFXPZX,"I was excited about this laptop based on all the reviews. But mine has so many problems that it's basically a $1000 paperweight. Won't stay connected to wireless, freezes so badly (multiple times a day) that it has to be hard restarted. Dell Customer Support is worse than useless. A quick check on some forums shows that lots of folks have the same issues I have. I have reinstalled the BIOS, updated every driver, to no avail.

B07ZSFXPZX,"Sin duda alguna es un producto espectacular en todos sus aspectos, llegó muy rápido, el empaque sin problemas.Puntos positivos:La construcción del equipo es completa en aluminio y fibra de carbono (me imagino que son materiales reales), la pantalla es espectacular en la versión 1080p (me imagino que la 4K es mejor) tiene mucho brillo y el táctil funciona sin problemas.El teclado se siente muy sólido y tiene un tacto espectacular al clickear, tiene retroiluminación y se ve muy bien, el trackpad sin problemas.La batería dura bastante facilmente 6 a7 horas y reduciendo todo el brillo y ahorro energético más de diez aunque con este modo se nota que disminuye un poco el rendimiento.Cosas negativas:La cámara del equipo no es tan buena, sin duda podría ser mejor.Tiene sólo entradas USB-C y el producto no viene con ningún adaptador.El procesador es bueno, pero siento que la 10a generación no es lo mejor sobretodo se siente en algunas ocasiones que el equipo se calienta un poco, no es tanto ni es un motivo para no comprar.",Excelente equipo y por el precio muy bueno.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2021",True,5.0
