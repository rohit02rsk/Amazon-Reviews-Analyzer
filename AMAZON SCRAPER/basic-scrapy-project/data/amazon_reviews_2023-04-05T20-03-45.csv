B09JFFG8D7,"Sorry I don‚Äôt have a photo to show of the phone. So I read all the reviews and expected to have to replace the battery upon arrival, maybe have blemishes or deal with a system lock out due to previous owner. Well, I lucked out. Battery was over 90%, zero blemishes, completely unlocked, and was super easy to set up. I know some got crap products but honestly after dealing with Best Buy I‚Äôm so fortunate this was legit. I will be using this service again for future phones. Just a word to the wise, NEVER SHOP AT BEST BUY. We ordered same phone same price refurbished, delivery to store would take a week. Got call next day that it was ready, called store they claim it wasn‚Äôt there. Called customer service said it was delivered and signed for. Waited a few days and got an update saying it was prepping for pick up but several days went by and still no status change. We go back and still they say no phone and it never got to the store. Called customer service yet again to find out Sammy signed for it days ago at the Southaven location. After dealing with this debacle we canceled order and reported as fraud. Turns out Sammy stole the phone and was trying to still charge our account. According to our bank this is not the first time Best Buy has done this. Never again.",Great,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2023",True,5.0
B09JFFG8D7,"This is the first iPhone I have purchased from Amazon's renewed products category. It is one of their Premium Renewed products that comes with a one-year satisfaction guarantee. At the time of purchase, it was on sale and priced almost $500 below the original iPhone 12 Pro Max 256GB selling price (when first introduced by Apple).The phone arrived promptly and was in perfect condition--it looked like a new iPhone! Included with the phone in the plain white box labelled ""Amazon Renewed"" was a generic white wall charger and lightning cable. I have been using it for a month now and it has worked flawlessly. Battery Health has held steady at 86% and I get over two days of internet browsing, emailing and texting before I need to recharge.This renewed iPhone from Amazon has far exceeded my expectations.

B09JFFG8D7,"I lost my phone a couple months back and had been saving up for an iPhone again. I was browsing all the Amazon sellers and after a phone I wanted, that was cheaper with more storage, I decided to go with this one. Kinda worked out for the best because the reviews of the other seller were kind of a mixed bag, some phones came scratched, others had poor battery life with max battery maxing out at 60-80%. Not mad about, once I thought about it I felt more comfortable buying from the Amazon store than a random seller. The phone arrived in a cute little Amazon box with set up instructions, a charging block and cord. Bummed it didn‚Äôt come with headphones like a new iPhone but that‚Äôs only because my headphones broke and I need a new pair lol. The phone itself was perfect, sit it next to a brand new 12 pro max and you could not distinguish a difference.

B09JFFG8D7,"UPDATE: I bought the premium renewed iphone for their one YEAR satisfaction GUARANTEE with free returns and a complete refund for any reason. I bought this in May of 2022 for $900 and returned this in December 2022 However after 3 weeks of waiting I finally got my refund for $794. After hours of being juggled between representatives I was finally told that there is a 100 dollar restocking fee despite no where anywhere was it explained that there would be a restocking fee. Amazon representatives on multiple times lied to me and refused to help resolve the situation the last person I spoke to Danica A in the Philippines claimed over our 40 mintue conversation that she was the head of Amazon worldwide customer service yet also saying that she had a supervisor but refused to connect me to them because they were not equipped to handle customer service issues....do you realize how insane that is she refused to give me any information that would allow me to report her to Amazon corporate office except her first name and last initial which was most likely a lie. I paid an extra 100 dollar (apprx) for the premium renewed plan but no one I spoke to even knew what that was. I cannot emphasize highly enough that you should avoid this at all cost because they will 100% screw you over bewhare do not do this do not buy this I can't emphatically explain to you enough why you need to avoid this. Unfortunately Amazons gotten so big and taken over so much of the market share that no one can compete with their prices so if I want a phone at a reasonable price I have to buy it from them. I've been a loyal customer for years and spent thousands of dollars of my money on them If I could never buy from them again I never would. That is how much they have damaged the customer loyalty bond. Just PLEASE BEWHARE what you risk if you go ahead and purchase something from them lies, deceit, manipulation, terrible service, financial loss, and hours of lost time being juggled between representatives.May 2022So this is my first experience with Amazon's renewed premium program where you pay between $50-$100 more than the renewed price but for that you get an item whose battery is at least at 90% capacity relative to a new one and instead of a 90 day warranty you get a year warranty and a year to return the item. For less than $100 I thought that was definitely worth it. However the first iPhone 12 pro they sent me had a battery that was at 85% capacity which really pissed me off because I felt cheated so I returned it and purchased it again and I'm glad I did because the 2nd ones battery was at 100% capacity and for all intents and purposes it was a brand new phone at a used price. Granted it's still really expensive it was $900 before tax but I got this to be future proof at least for the next several years. This is my first iPhone before I was all android phones but it seemed like every year I was having to buy another phone because something out of my control always happened but my parents still had their iPhone 8 that they bought new and it was still working perfectly. I haven't had this phone for more than a few days but so far I'm very impressed with it. The facial recognition capabilities are so good. My phone can recognize me when I'm in a dark room whereas my Samsung tablet can't recognize my face without all the lights on. One feature this phone doesn't have that really surprised me was that there is no built in fingerprint scanner and I think that was a mistake on apple's part. The battery is supposed to only last 21 hours but a full charge is lasting me a little over 2 days. The screen is gorgeous is it HDR Dolby Vision and HLG compatible and not even my 4k tv supports all of those so it makes streaming look brilliant. You can see every detail even though the screen is 6.7inches. it seems like everyday I'm finding out a new function that this phone has granted a lot them I'll never use because I don't use my phone that way but it's cool to know that if I wanted to I could if I so choosed. I guess I'll stop my review here because you get the gist and I hate it when people on Amazon beat a dead horse and I don't want to be one of those so Amazon renewed premium is a worthwhile program and the iPhone 12 pro max is an awesome phone that's worth the investment.",Took twice but it was worth it! update Jan 2023,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022",True,1.0

But it is a 2 year ol phone. I plan on putting a screen protector on the glass which will cover the scratches on the screen and a case will cover the phone.The device came in a white amazon made for iphone box. It also included a non OEM charger and a non OEM lighting cord with all kinds of paper work about how I'm saving the environment, by buying a refurbished phone (who Knew)  I guess that what they mean when you buy a premium.

B09JFFG8D7,"I had the exact same experience as Mr. Philip Chaplin. I was refunded $770 for a $947 phone. The phone's mic had issues. I was obviously not satisfied with the purchase. Getting it picked up by the carrier for return was a hassle. It was sitting nicely packed with me for 2 months because Amazon wouldn't allow anything other than a pickup. Frustrated, I escalated the issue and finally a manager created a drop-off label for me.Now, Amazon receives it and refunds me 80%. Now starts a series of calls and emails with Amazon where I have to explain to reps about their own renewed premium policy. Many don't know that it exists. So what do they do? They do 2 things- 1. they lie by saying I'm past the 30-day return window (remember, it's a renewed premium product with 365 days window), so I'm charged restocking fee. 2. after me telling them about amazon's renewed guarantee and upon seeing they were wrong, they then lie by saying I returned a damaged product. On asking to be sent the damage details via email, there's no answer.It's a cycle of lies and incompetence by Amazon customer service. The reps avoid my request when asked to escalate the issue. They keep repeating the same thing- ""our system is not allowing to process a refund for the restocking fee because the item is past the return window."" Well, WHY was I even charged the fee when the return window is 365 days!? Then again it's the same cycle that starts with me explaining them about renewed premium. What is even the point of renewed premium when you were falsely advertised to and not issued full refund, which is promised by Amazon?Every time, the story starts from scratch- explain to them about the situation, and they place me on hold to check details and then for them to tell me it's past the return window.

B09JFFG8D7,"I ordered the iPhone 12 Max Pro Premium thinking I had eliminated all the problems associated with buying a used phone.  The ""Premium"" in the purchase was a promise of a cosmetically excellent iPhone with a one-year guarantee and a minimum battery health of 90%.  Well, therein lies the rub.  The exterior of the phone was excellent but upon checking the battery health I found it to be 87%.  I might have been willing to accept it, but I noticed on the inspection card that all items had been checked off including the 90% battery health, but the card had not been signed or initialed.  I started thinking about what else had not been checked so I boxed it up and sent it back.  I'll try it again because I believe that one person doesn't make or break a company.",A little disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 18, 2022",True,2.0
B09JFFG8D7,"My first iPhone coming from a Galaxy 9+ and I‚Äôve been loving it.

B09JFFG8D7,"The battery capacity is 88%. There is a scratch. Not a bad phone, but at an inflated price. The seller needs to better check the phones before shipping. I decided not to return it, as it is a long process, and shipping back by dhl would cost $ 210 (the order was not made in the USA).","Not a bad phone, but at an inflated price.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 21, 2023",True,2.0
B09JFFG8D7,"So I first had ordered this phone but it was only renewed, I got the phone and it was in bad shape, so I returned it. Then I came across Amazon renewed premium so I decided to give it one more shot. They promised that the batter life would be above 90% so I took a chance. I was absolutely blown away, when I got the phone all setup I viewed the battery health and it was 100%!

B09JFFG8D7,"It seems like a pretty functional phone.. appears to work well in most capacities other than the battery, which is right off the bat draining very quickly with very mild usage. (Was assured to be at 90+%)(the last refurbished iPhone I bought came at 98% and after 2 years of usage is at 92%) So it‚Äôs a bit of a bummer because I‚Äôm just going to have to get the battery replaced soon. I honestly might just exchange the phone soon, just throughout writing this review the battery has drained 7%‚Ä¶. That is terrible in my opinion.",Battery health at 90%,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 8, 2022",True,3.0
B09JFFG8D7,"Yah these guys don‚Äôt follow the renewed premium guides what so ever. I was supposed to receive a phone in like new condition. Instead what I received was super dirty in the crevices, covered with micro scratches on the side that I can see farther than arms length away. The battery is supposed to come with minimum guaranteed 90% battery health, it only came with 88%. When I put my ear to the phone to talk to people they are WHISPER quiet. I can barely hear anything and have to talk to people on speaker phone. They literally sent me a broken phone for renewed premium price and Amazon won‚Äôt refund me the difference between renewed premium and renewed pricing. I can‚Äôt just return this phone and buy a new one because all my data is on this phone now. I highly recommend don‚Äôt be cheap and get a new phone, or just have really low expectations when you buy renewed premium instead.",Pretty much got scammed by Amazon,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 4, 2023",True,1.0

B09JFFG8D7,"After deciding I wanted to upgrade my phone I figured that going the ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù direction was the most affordable option. I must say I was very hesitant at first. Even when I got the device, the plastic on it gave the impression it was banged up and the screen possibly cracked. Luckily for me I realized it was just the plastic, and after removing the phone looked as though it came straight out the apple store. It works just as good as well.
