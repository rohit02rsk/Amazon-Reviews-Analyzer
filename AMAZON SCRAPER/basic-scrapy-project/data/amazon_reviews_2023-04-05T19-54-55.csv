B09JFFG8D7,"Sorry I don’t have a photo to show of the phone. So I read all the reviews and expected to have to replace the battery upon arrival, maybe have blemishes or deal with a system lock out due to previous owner. Well, I lucked out. Battery was over 90%, zero blemishes, completely unlocked, and was super easy to set up. I know some got crap products but honestly after dealing with Best Buy I’m so fortunate this was legit. I will be using this service again for future phones. Just a word to the wise, NEVER SHOP AT BEST BUY. We ordered same phone same price refurbished, delivery to store would take a week. Got call next day that it was ready, called store they claim it wasn’t there. Called customer service said it was delivered and signed for. Waited a few days and got an update saying it was prepping for pick up but several days went by and still no status change. We go back and still they say no phone and it never got to the store. Called customer service yet again to find out Sammy signed for it days ago at the Southaven location. After dealing with this debacle we canceled order and reported as fraud. Turns out Sammy stole the phone and was trying to still charge our account. According to our bank this is not the first time Best Buy has done this. Never again.",Great,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 3, 2023",True,5.0
B09JFFG8D7,"This is the first iPhone I have purchased from Amazon's renewed products category. It is one of their Premium Renewed products that comes with a one-year satisfaction guarantee. At the time of purchase, it was on sale and priced almost $500 below the original iPhone 12 Pro Max 256GB selling price (when first introduced by Apple).The phone arrived promptly and was in perfect condition--it looked like a new iPhone! Included with the phone in the plain white box labelled ""Amazon Renewed"" was a generic white wall charger and lightning cable. I have been using it for a month now and it has worked flawlessly. Battery Health has held steady at 86% and I get over two days of internet browsing, emailing and texting before I need to recharge.This renewed iPhone from Amazon has far exceeded my expectations.

B09JFFG8D7,"I lost my phone a couple months back and had been saving up for an iPhone again. I was browsing all the Amazon sellers and after a phone I wanted, that was cheaper with more storage, I decided to go with this one. Kinda worked out for the best because the reviews of the other seller were kind of a mixed bag, some phones came scratched, others had poor battery life with max battery maxing out at 60-80%. Not mad about, once I thought about it I felt more comfortable buying from the Amazon store than a random seller. The phone arrived in a cute little Amazon box with set up instructions, a charging block and cord. Bummed it didn’t come with headphones like a new iPhone but that’s only because my headphones broke and I need a new pair lol. The phone itself was perfect, sit it next to a brand new 12 pro max and you could not distinguish a difference. Set up was fine, everything works great so far, the battery health is at 96% which is decent.

B09JFFG8D7,"UPDATE: I bought the premium renewed iphone for their one YEAR satisfaction GUARANTEE with free returns and a complete refund for any reason. I bought this in May of 2022 for $900 and returned this in December 2022 However after 3 weeks of waiting I finally got my refund for $794. After hours of being juggled between representatives I was finally told that there is a 100 dollar restocking fee despite no where anywhere was it explained that there would be a restocking fee. Amazon representatives on multiple times lied to me and refused to help resolve the situation the last person I spoke to Danica A in the Philippines claimed over our 40 mintue conversation that she was the head of Amazon worldwide customer service yet also saying that she had a supervisor but refused to connect me to them because they were not equipped to handle customer service issues....do you realize how insane that is she refused to give me any information that would allow me to report her to Amazon corporate office except her first name and last initial which was most likely a lie. I paid an extra 100 dollar (apprx) for the premium renewed plan but no one I spoke to even knew what that was. I cannot emphasize highly enough that you should avoid this at all cost because they will 100% screw you over bewhare do not do this do not buy this I can't emphatically explain to you enough why you need to avoid this. Unfortunately Amazons gotten so big and taken over so much of the market share that no one can compete with their prices so if I want a phone at a reasonable price I have to buy it from them. I've been a loyal customer for years and spent thousands of dollars of my money on them If I could never buy from them again I never would. That is how much they have damaged the customer loyalty bond. Just PLEASE BEWHARE what you risk if you go ahead and purchase something from them lies, deceit, manipulation, terrible service, financial loss, and hours of lost time being juggled between representatives.May 2022So this is my first experience with Amazon's renewed premium program where you pay between $50-$100 more than the renewed price but for that you get an item whose battery is at least at 90% capacity relative to a new one and instead of a 90 day warranty you get a year warranty and a year to return the item. For less than $100 I thought that was definitely worth it. However the first iPhone 12 pro they sent me had a battery that was at 85% capacity which really pissed me off because I felt cheated so I returned it and purchased it again and I'm glad I did because the 2nd ones battery was at 100% capacity and for all intents and purposes it was a brand new phone at a used price. Granted it's still really expensive it was $900 before tax but I got this to be future proof at least for the next several years. This is my first iPhone before I was all android phones but it seemed like every year I was having to buy another phone because something out of my control always happened but my parents still had their iPhone 8 that they bought new and it was still working perfectly. I haven't had this phone for more than a few days but so far I'm very impressed with it. The facial recognition capabilities are so good. My phone can recognize me when I'm in a dark room whereas my Samsung tablet can't recognize my face without all the lights on. One feature this phone doesn't have that really surprised me was that there is no built in fingerprint scanner and I think that was a mistake on apple's part. The battery is supposed to only last 21 hours but a full charge is lasting me a little over 2 days. The screen is gorgeous is it HDR Dolby Vision and HLG compatible and not even my 4k tv supports all of those so it makes streaming look brilliant. You can see every detail even though the screen is 6.7inches. it seems like everyday I'm finding out a new function that this phone has granted a lot them I'll never use because I don't use my phone that way but it's cool to know that if I wanted to I could if I so choosed. I guess I'll stop my review here because you get the gist and I hate it when people on Amazon beat a dead horse and I don't want to be one of those so Amazon renewed premium is a worthwhile program and the iPhone 12 pro max is an awesome phone that's worth the investment.",Took twice but it was worth it! update Jan 2023,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022",True,1.0

B09JFFG8D7,"I had the exact same experience as Mr. Philip Chaplin. I was refunded $770 for a $947 phone. The phone's mic had issues. I was obviously not satisfied with the purchase. Getting it picked up by the carrier for return was a hassle. It was sitting nicely packed with me for 2 months because Amazon wouldn't allow anything other than a pickup. Frustrated, I escalated the issue and finally a manager created a drop-off label for me.Now, Amazon receives it and refunds me 80%. Now starts a series of calls and emails with Amazon where I have to explain to reps about their own renewed premium policy. Many don't know that it exists. So what do they do? They do 2 things- 1. they lie by saying I'm past the 30-day return window (remember, it's a renewed premium product with 365 days window), so I'm charged restocking fee. 2. after me telling them about amazon's renewed guarantee and upon seeing they were wrong, they then lie by saying I returned a damaged product. On asking to be sent the damage details via email, there's no answer.It's a cycle of lies and incompetence by Amazon customer service. The reps avoid my request when asked to escalate the issue. They keep repeating the same thing- ""our system is not allowing to process a refund for the restocking fee because the item is past the return window."" Well, WHY was I even charged the fee when the return window is 365 days!? Then again it's the same cycle that starts with me explaining them about renewed premium. What is even the point of renewed premium when you were falsely advertised to and not issued full refund, which is promised by Amazon?Every time, the story starts from scratch- explain to them about the situation, and they place me on hold to check details and then for them to tell me it's past the return window.

I might have been willing to accept it, but I noticed on the inspection card that all items had been checked off including the 90% battery health, but the card had not been signed or initialed.  I started thinking about what else had not been checked so I boxed it up and sent it back.

B09JFFG8D7,"Primera vez que compro un equipo renovado. No sabía que esperar. En Apple resulta que los equipos RENOVADOS PREMIUM son mejores y tienen una garantía más larga que los No Premium. Este teléfono que compré venía en una caja blanca con verde de AMAZON y en el interior un cable y cargador genéricos. Al remover la protección de plástico del teléfono, mi sorpresa fue encontrar un equipo PRÁCTICAMENTE NUEVO. Ningún golpe ni marca de otro tipo. Lo único que encontré (y porque le estuve buscando algo) una rayita diminuta en la pantalla junto al marco. Raya superficial de unos dos milímetros… La batería está al 91% y al encenderlo de inmediato se actualizo el sistema operativo a IOS 16.1.2TODO, todo funciona muy bien. No se nota la diferencia entre un equipo nuevo y este. Definitivamente, es una Excelente inversión y decisión ir por este equipo.COMPLEMENTO:Al 27 de diciembre 2022, el equipo no ha fallado. Sigo impresionado. Ya actualizó a IOS 16.2 y todas las apps funcionan de maravilla. Cabe mencionar que encontré un “short” en YouTube donde hace referencia a como identificar los equipos usados que se adquieren y refiere que los que Sí en NÚMERO DE MODELO inician con letra “M” como es mi caso, el equipo es totalmente ORIGINAL Y NO HA SIDO REPARADO… Algo que me da todavía más tranquilidad y ganas de recomendar esta compra.Sí empieza con “F” es un equipo reacondicionado por Apple.Sí aparece una “P” fue comprada en línea o personalizada.Sí aparece una “N” es un equipo de reemplazo por reparación.Sí NO TIENE ESTE CÓDIGO entonces No es iPhone Original.Salu2 desde 🇲🇽",¡INCREIBLE!,"Reviewed in Mexico on December 6, 2022",True,5.0

Llegó en un empaque sellado de Amazon con blizter y cable y cargador, recomiendo comprar los cables y cargador original.3. Pantalla llegó con 2 ligeros rayones superficiales, pero eran 2 rayones que solo se notaban con pantalla apagada a contra luz y en un ángulo de 45 grados, al ponerle una mica protectora de cristal templado a la pantalla es imposible percibirla, por lo cual le doy un 9.9 en estética4. Todo con Apple care del teléfono resulta ser original, nada de piezas remplazadas o algo por el estilo aún conserva garantía con Apple por casi 8 meses quiere decir que el teléfono estuvo 4 meses en uso, lo cual puedo deducir que era de exhibición lo cual me complace saber que es un teléfono virtualmente nuevo",Maravillado,"Reviewed in Mexico on February 13, 2023",True,5.0

B09JFFG8D7,"Cuando uno compra un artículo tiene ciertas expectativas sobre él. En este caso, bajo la promesa de ser un artículo reacondicionado premium y de ser vendido y enviado por Amazon, esperaba que al menos cumpliera con lo escrito en la descripción.En primer lugar, el embalaje del producto protege a la perfección el contenido del paquete, no obstante, sentí algo de ansiedad al no ver que en algún lugar dijera ""premium"", por lo que pensé que tal vez pagué más dinero (de hecho aún tengo la duda) y me enviaron un reacondicionado cualquiera.Cuando abrí el paquete me dispuse a verificar el teléfono y todo resultó (o eso creí) excelente. Al encender el teléfono por primera vez, éste no prendió ni dio señales de vida. Me asusté, aunque conserve la calma y lo puse a cargar. Procedí a revisarlo mientras tanto. Estética 10/10. Una vez con carga, empecé una análisis más profundo: al parecer, todas las piezas originales, cero rayones y funcionalidad sin ningún problema. Todo bien hasta que recordé la principal razón de elegir un reacondicionado premium: la batería. Revisando en ajustes me di cuenta del único gran detalle: el porcentaje de batería del dispositivo es del 86%.Me molestó bastante el hecho de pagar más por la promesa de una batería de al menos el 90% y que me hayan engañado con un porcentaje menor me parece de lo más bajo por parte de Amazon. De hecho, pensé en regresarlo el mismo día por tal motivo. Al final desistí debido a que se me hacia engorroso el tema de garantía de enviar a EUA, esperar a que lo reciban y revisen, a que me reembolsen y luego pedir otra vez el producto. Si bien ya tenía presupuestado el cambio de batería en tal vez un par de años, ahora será mucho antes debido a la menor vida útil.En conclusión, el producto y la calidad en general son excelentes, sin embargo, la batería le resta muchísimos puntos. Además, me quedó con una sensación agridulce y de duda sobre si realmente es un producto reacondicionado premium o solo me dieron arroz con el dedo como decimos en México.",Todo excelente... excepto por lo que lo compré.,"Reviewed in Mexico on February 7, 2023",True,3.0
