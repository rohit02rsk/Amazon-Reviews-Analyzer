B091BCCTND,"I had previously owned a ReDragon keyboard and mouse combo, but it was wired and didn't have the number pad either. So while building my new computer, I decided to purchase a wireless keyboard/mouse combo. I ordered from a name I never heard of before. Big mistake. The keyboard and mouse were cheap and did not work as advertised. I then found a ReDragon wireless keyboard/mouse combo and quickly decided to buy it.This combo is solid and well built and works quite well. The one and only drawback is that the mouse requires 2 AA batteries. The keyboard charges with a USB cable. I was hoping that the mouse would also charge with a USB cable. But all in all, I'd recommend this set to anyone looking at it.",Love ReDragon keyboard and mouse,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 29, 2023",True,5.0
B091BCCTND,"...it works. The mouse has nice weight to it with two AA batteries inside. (batteries not included) The mouse is excellent. 5 DPI settings. ECO mode. Just the right button touch. Easy scrolling wheel. I have large hands, all the buttons are in just the right place.I like the keyboard but I wish it were brighter. 8 colors. 5 brightness levels. Media player controls. Other convenient hotkeys.This a decent wireless m/k combo with a reasonable price point. Recommended.","Not the best, but...","Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 1, 2023",True,4.0
B091BCCTND,I have this for a few months and while the RGB works well I've noticed some slight slipping in the keyboard and mouse after 4 months of use. This combo is my daily driver for my PC and I use my PC both for gaming and business. If you do a lot of gaming spend the extra money and get a TRUE mechanical keyboard and mouse. If you just using it for standard 9-5 type of work this will suit your needs no problem.,Good but slight slipping,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on December 12, 2022",True,4.0

    Â I play Genshin Impact and will admit Iâ€™m not that great, but I can spam the buttons and it didnâ€™t affect the keyboard. I used to have the other brand you can get at all electronics stores and would go through those every 6 monthsâ€¦ but Iâ€™ve had this now for a month and itâ€™s still going strong!The internal battery life of the keyboard however is lacking. I also use it for work and it only lasted 24-25 hours when I left it unplugged.  -Ainâ€™t nobody got time to charge that- so now I leave it plugged in all the time. No place to put batteries in.The mouse is freaking crazy awesome in battery life. I set off batteries and itâ€™s still going strong. (I do turn both off when Iâ€™m done for the day) One thing I didnâ€™t like so much was the sensitivity of the mouse when it first arrived but that has gone away now.Overall Iâ€™m happy with the purchase. And for the price? I just hope it lasts a yearâ€¦",Not so wireless,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on September 10, 2022",True,4.0
B091BCCTND,The mouse is fine but the keyboard quality is not great and has very short range. I bought these to use on my coffee table to run my PC connected to my TV. The keyboard does not work more than maybe 6ft from the PC.,Very short range,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 3, 2023",True,3.0

B091BCCTND,"A lot of ppl complained about this shutting off but i like it because u dont have to worry about the battery draining everyday. All u have to do is push any button and its ready with no delay. Not too bright but bright enough, different color settings, music controls work awesome. Only thing is i wish it had a bigger battery lol but i dont ever want to charge it.",Worth it,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on December 12, 2022",True,5.0

B091BCCTND,"I really enjoyed the whole setup when it all worked. Constant issue I did have, was the keyboard would die so quickly. I get the RGB, but way too often compared to battery powered keyboards. Mind you this keyboard is charging only, but the accompanied mouse is battery. Sad to say, but I feel it didn't live up to expectations.",Keyboard dead 7 months,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 22, 2023",True,2.0
B091BCCTND,I absolutely love this keyboard and mouse set. Iâ€™ve used Redragon previously with a wired set and now this wireless set.I work from home and the keyboard gives me a 5 day work week worth of charge with 10+ hours (I typically donâ€™t take a lunch away from my computer) going at it in on an average day. I like that itâ€™s mechanical without a large raise of keys.,Love this keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on October 3, 2022",True,5.0
