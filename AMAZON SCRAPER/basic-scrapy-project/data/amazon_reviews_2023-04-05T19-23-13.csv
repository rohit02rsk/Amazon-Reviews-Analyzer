B0BCNLGVMH,"I was worried about buying an office chair online.  This chair definitely exceeded my expectations!  It was easy to assemble.  I love having armrests that can flip out of the way if needed.  The chair lifts or lowers to the desired height and can rock back and forth.  The cushioning, although it felt stiff at first, is just right for good support and comfort.  I have an injured tailbone and find it amazingly comfortable without using my cushion pad.  The chair fits my petite size (5'3"").  The gray and white color blends well into my home decor.  I will purchase again for my other office!",GREAT CHAIR!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 2, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"This is the first review I’ve ever wrote, honest. This is a very good chair for the price.  The elevating spindle on my second hand luxury chair was going bad, so I began looking around the net.  Other reviews indicated this was an excellent chair for a low price. With many favorable ratings to its credit I decided to purchase it.  I can report that it is very satisfactory.  It is light enough to move around with ease, even from room to room. Viewing the wheel casters online, I was worried about their strength, as they look a little flimsy in pictures.  However, the casters turned out to be very substantial.  After viewing the online video showing its assembly, it was no problem to put the chair together.  I like it, for the usable value and low price.  Yes, I would recommend it to others.",Well Pleased,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 27, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"Great chair! I have been looking for a new chair for my desk where I do most of my work on and I just wanted an office chair! I found this one and decided to order. It was surprisingly easy to assemble, and it’s really comfortable compared to my previous chair. Overall I recommend this chair! It’s simple, works great and minimalist for my space!",Great chair!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 31, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"The chair was super easy to assemble. We assembled it as we watched TV one night and didn’t have any issues putting it together. The back piece is great for some added support and the mesh fabric makes the chair more breathable, which is great since my husband is using it in the office area for gaming purposes (so he’s usually sitting in the chair for a bit when he games). He’s had zero complaints!",Great!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 29, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"Well,  I have not found any negative side of the product. At first, I thought that it would be challenging to assemble the whole chair however it turned out to be easy assemble. Since I have been using the chair for a while, I have found it comfortable and flexible: I move around and sit on it, put my back on it. I believe with this price range  this product is the best one",Easy to assemble and comfortable to seat on,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 26, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"I was looking for an office chair that was comfortable, but took up very little space.  The chair I was using make my  back and hips hurt and would not fit under my home office desk.  I took a chance and ordered this one.  I LOVE it.  It is very easy to put together, extremely comfortable and fits great in a small space. When I flip the arms up it will slide right under my desk which has a drop down keyboard drawer. The chair is not only comfortable but looks very nice as well.",Most Comfortable Office Chair,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 16, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,I got this chair for my home office.  It was very easy to assemble.  I love that the arms flip up so the chair can be fully pushed under the desk when not in use.  It is very comfortable and supportive even on those day I had back pain.  I would definitely recommend it and purchase again if I need another office chair!!,Supportive with back pain,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 29, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"Working from home half time and trying to find the best ergonomic set up for small space.  I’m 5’3” and found the adjustable chair height good, but I believe my desk is too tall for proper ergonomics and I have to use a cushion to sit higher.  I probably need to look for a new desk!! The back support is good if you sit all the way back but I tend to sit closer to front edge of chair to reach the keyboard as I am doing virtual meetings all day and typing on keyboard during most of my meetings. The support length under thigh is good although I wish the front end could be tilted up a little as it feels like it is sloping down a little and it might be due to not enough cushioning in front.  The arm support is at good height for ergonomics but I tend not to use the arm rests as the height of my desk and level of arm rests don’t allow me to scoot chair in close enough due to my desk style.  I do love being able to fold the arms up for storage when I’m not using it to make more space. I’m not sure if the chair is supposed to rock back or lean back but it took a lot of effort for me to make it lean back.  My 6’ tall husband sat in chair and says it was comfortable and he was able to rock the chair back and forth with no effort.Price was decent- I purchased during Black Friday sale.Easy to assemble, all parts included, no additional tools needed.  My teenage son put it together quickly",Good for the price,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 1, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"I needed a new computer chair and was hesitant to purchase one via Amazon because you can't see it's dimensions in person. I seen this chair was on sale so I thought, just buy it if it isn't suitable, it could easily be returned.No returning necessary! I absolutely love it! It was easy to assemble. It's very comfortable. I absolutely love how the arms go up. It slides in under my desk very nicely. Great for sitting at a desk especially if you are there for a few hours at a time. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",Very satisfied!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 13, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"is a must-have for anyone who spends long hours sitting at a desk. A good desk chair should be comfortable, adjustable, and provide proper support to prevent back pain and discomfort. Ergonomic chairs are a popular choice, as they are designed to promote good posture and reduce strain on the body. Investing in a high-quality desk chair can improve productivity and reduce the risk of developing physical ailments associated with prolonged sitting.",Great comfortable chair.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 25, 2023",True,5.0
