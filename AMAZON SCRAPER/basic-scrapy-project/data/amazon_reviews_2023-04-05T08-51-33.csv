B0B8DBG2RK,"The pink bunny chair is very good quality, and Iâ€™ve already sat on it a lot and itâ€™s very comfy. The foot rest is very very good and sturdy. The only thing that I would complain about is the fact that the massager doesnâ€™t work even though Iâ€™ve plug it in to many outlets and checked to see if there was an on off switch but there wasnâ€™t but other than that itâ€™s very very good quality and worth the buy. Also the chair came in like 5 days which is also a plus.",Very good quality,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 3, 2023",True,4.0
B0B8DBG2RK,"Great quality, simple assembly instructions. Colors arenâ€™t faded and itâ€™s very sturdy. Note that this chair is a bit bigger than I anticipated but I was happy about the fact. The lower back pillow has a massager inside of it which I didnâ€™t know as well but again another great addition. It doesnâ€™t recline all the way back but it goes a good distance. Overall I love it.",She loves the Product!!,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 15, 2023",True,4.0
B0B8DBG2RK,"The chair is comfortable, but it came with no instructions and the back pillow isnâ€™t the same one thatâ€™s in the picture. Those things aside I think the chair is worth the money.",Came with no instructions,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 28, 2023",True,4.0
B0B8DBG2RK,"I love this chair so much! I will say after a couple hours my bum gets sore so Iâ€™ll pick up a little chair pillow, but this is the best chair ever :-)",So cute,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 28, 2023",True,5.0
B0B8DBG2RK,It is very comfortable. Im confused abt the stool but i get it to work either way! The massager part is soo nice. A little uncomfortable to just keep on the chair. I forgot to put the bunny tail on before handles. (I found the paw pillow on amazon),Comfortable,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 20, 2023",True,5.0
B0B8DBG2RK,"Pros: SUPER DUPER CUTE, the bunny ears are detachable, leg rest is super convenient and it reclines so far back without the feeling of falling back and the lumbar support is really niceCons: seat is uncomfy for the first month until you break it in I recommend getting a seat cushion, and the massager is not really anything to brag about itâ€™s just like a very light vibration lol but nonetheless a nice addition although I donâ€™t use itBut the pros definitely out weigh the cons and this chair was worth every penny.",Great for the price,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 23, 2023",True,5.0
