B00NLZUM36,"I didn't get this for gaming. I needed a backlit keyboard to replace an ancient one and this one has some features similar to the old one. The wide wrist rest for one thing. It's not a slim keyboard like the junky ones you get with your new computer. If it were a boat, I'd call it beamy.What I like:It lights up. Pick a color or do what I'm trying and just leaving it at all colors. My eyes feel less strained using the mix.It's quiet without being mushy. The keys feel like and old typewriter if anyone out there is old enough to recall those. It makes for very easy typing.That it's not wireless. I like a wireless mouse, but a wireless keyboard is not worth it to me since I'm not actually dragging the wire around like I would with a mouse. Nothing to eat more batteries.What I don't like:The back row of keys do not light up. Not that I have much use for any of them, but it seems weird that they made it so they cannot be seen in the dark.So far, the likes outweigh the don't likes.The mouse. No clue on that. I won't be using it. I looked at it and it seems to have a lot of buttons to play with, but it would not replace my wireless small mouse that just fits my hand.I would recommend this if you're looking for a decent backlit keyboard. I do have it on a sliding keyboard tray with the back props up and it still has room to slide away. The measurements were not given in the specs so I wasn't sure it would work, but it does.",Can't rate gaming so 3 stars for that,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2023",True,4.0

B00NLZUM36,Updated after enough use to adequately review 12/10/22:The keys are a tad bit too small. The mouse after one day - right mouse button sticks. I use it to toggle zoom so I don't press and hold it I just tap it. The left button does have a satisfying click and the resolution of the mouse improved gaming performance by an order of magnitude.Interesting but true - see picture - this keyboard has two R keys. The left R key is actually the E key.I can touch type on the keyboard but it takes some getting used to because of the small size of the keys and the smaller than usual spacing. I will live with it for a while but I should have bought a mechanical keyboard.This will definitely improve your gaming performance if you are currently using any form of wireless mouse.

B00NLZUM36,"Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the ""you get what you pay for"" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange ""tall"" type that relocates the ""\"" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. ""#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?"" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... ""What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return"". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.","You cannot get a better keyboard and mouse combo in this price range, I am certain of it.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 20, 2016",True,5.0

I spent a lot of time using the computer, and I game a LOT.  It's not clicky, but I can still feel the press of each key when I'm using it.  I love the low profile buttons.  The lighting is beautiful, I rotate through a few of the different colors and lighting effects.  My favorites are the pastel rainbow, and the mode that slowly fades through each color on a rotation. My one and only complaint would be that the finish on the keys is wearing off.  I've only had this for two months now, and as you can see by my picture, the paint on the WASD and space bar is wearing off in places.  The corners of the 2 and 3 buttons are also wearing off as my nail hits against it when I'm hitting my W key.  But again, I game a LOT, as I said.

The first one, the space bar didn't work, but the style and design are good, I figured I'd give it another try.Disclaimer, I have not tried as a gaming keyboard functions yet. This review is just for regular keyboard and mouse function.-Pros: Quiet, good feel while typing, keys feel like a mechanical keyboard without the loud clicking, back lighting is descent.  A nice looking unit.The mouse is stylish, and will work good ""as is"" but you need to download the free driver and suite (suite loads with the driver). once suite is loaded the mouse becomes very adjustable to your needs.-Cons: Had read other buyers say they had same problem with space bar and other other keys. To me, a keyboard should be about typing first, everything else second. Just me. but this second one works is great. Can't find anything else to complain about, but again this doesn't cover the gaming functions.The mouse. The mouse comes with the LED set to ""slow"" pulse. so if you don't download the driver (suite built in) you have a standard mouse with a red ""heart beat"" back light (default setting). Yes, the light for the mouse can only be controlled from the suite! As I stated it was free Red Dragon site, and installed quick and easy....on my personal laptop.I work remote now and work on a company computer as well. I usually just pop the USB hub from one to the other.But can't put the driver on work computer. Enter mouse with a red ""heart beat"" light for 8 hours.Good for your personal computer, but probably not for a work environment. Will have to live with it for now.Included instructions are basic at best, and even going on YouTube couldn't find a lot of help with what all the programmable/gaming keys could do.-Overall, good value for the price, as my son sent over $120 on his gaming keyboard (SMH).I would just advise to buy ""sold by Amazon"" as I got my replacement within two days.Updated (09/14/2020) On work computer, running large cad program and multiple file docs, along with other programs. The mouse was very glitchy. I realized running though the USB hub made the mouse commands even moving the cursor  ‚Äúwait in line‚Äù to be executed. Not a long delay, but long enough to be aggravating. Computer is brand new, top self HP. So not the computer. Never had this problem with my wireless trackball mouse, with dongle plugged into hub.

B00NLZUM36,"If you can spare two USB ports, this set is a fantastic bargain.  Maybe there's more customization on more expensive gaming keyboards - this is my first step into the field.  However, everything works great and I honestly have no complaints.  It exceeded my expectations so far (A month or two of use so far).2020 Update:I liked my first Redragon set enough to buy a second set for at work.  The price is still right, and everything still looks and feels great.  A few things have changed, though.The keyboard is now RGB backlit rather than plain unlit keys with red LED embellishments.  There are FN controls to regulate the ""breathing"" (light-dark pulsing) of the keyboard, which is good because I found it distracting.  The included instruction booklet lists these key combinations.  FN+END pauses and unpauses breathing.  FN+PGDN enables and disables the backlight entirely.  FN+PGUP rotates through 3 still rainbow lighting arrangements.  FN+HOME rotates through 7 monochromatic colors (white, blue, red, green, purple, yellow, and cyan).  FN+INS smoothly transitions through the 7 colors over the course of a few seconds, though to my eyes the brightness was uneven.  FN+UP and FN+DN scale through 4 levels of brightness, and FN+LEFT and FN+RIGHT scale through 4 speeds of animation.For my money, the backlight will be kept motionless on a monochrome light, but to each their own.All told, very happy with the keyboard.  It also features two new sets of buttons above the F-row, which are oddly not backlit.  The set to left of center includes links to My Computer, Search, Refresh, Email, Calculator, and Home Page.  The keys to the right are media controls for Stop, Last Track, Play/Pause, and Next Track.  These are all fine, but unnecessary since the F-row already has FN shortcuts to most of these things, and the topmost row, again, isn't backlit.And we have the mouse.  It feels identical to the previous mouse, though it has 4 DPI settings rather than 3.  There's a catch though, which is that the mouse backlight (red only) is set to ""breathe"" by default.  To disable this, you'll need to download software from the Redragon support page.  Although my mouse and keyboard both list their parts # as S101-3, the mouse is actually a M601-3 CENTROPHORUS.  You'll need to download the drivers for this mouse in order to disable breathing.  All the way left on the software's slider will disable the light fully, and all the way right will leave it permanently backlit (my preference).  The other new thing with the mouse is that a LED flashes when you change DPI; it's flash speed correlating to how high the DPI is.  It seems unnecessary but harmless.All told, my first impression is that the addition of pulsing lights just makes first time setup harder as you need to track down the software for the mouse and learn the keyboard controls.  I want to take off a half point for the mouse not having a hardware option to disable the light, but all told I'll keep my rating at a 5 as the backlit keys are actually an improvement once you learn how to freeze them.*****",Need a super keyboard and mouse for under $30?

B00NLZUM36,"Ok, so I bought this keyboard and mouse combo from Red Dragon back in March 2020. I wanted to spend most of my money on the CPU, graphics card, etc... so I didn't have a ton of money to spend on a badass keyboard and mouse. Plus this was the first actual PC I built that didn't run like a potato. When I found this keyboard and mouse combo for only $30, I was shocked and a bit skeptical. I ordered it thinking it was going to be complete crap and would have to upgrade soon after, but I was wrong! Sure if you ask any pro gamers they would say it's crap, but to me, it was and still is (for the most part) amazing. Much nicer than I thought a $30 keyboard and mouse combo would be. I will say that after about one and a half years of ownership (and daily use), the keyboard still works perfectly fine and has no issues whatsoever. The mouse, however, I can't say the same for. The mouse was great I but noticed about a month ago, the rear side button started getting stuck and not working properly. I died a few times in Call of Duty Warzone because of it and couldn't go back to my previous pages when sifting through my web browser. So I decided it was time to throw it away and get an upgrade. Other than that rear side button giving out and getting stuck, the mouse still worked fine, but I decided I wanted an upgrade anyway to a better mouse with customizable RGB lighting. The keyboard has good customizable RGB lighting options but the mouse was always one solid color, red. Overall, this combo is amazing for beginners! Primarily for someone who doesn't want to spend too much money on a keyboard and mouse that can also be used for daily work, school work, and gaming purposes.

B00NLZUM36,"It's true that you get what you pay for.  I bought this keyboard/mouse set after buying another set for $20.99 on Amazon made by ChonChow (see my 3 stars review there for that) - I almost regretted that purchase because there were more negatives than positives about that keyboard and finally bought this RedDragon after my cat chew through the Chonchow keyboard usb cord last week.  I now wrap my usb cords with aluminum foil - read that cats don't like to chew on aluminum foil.The RedDragon costs about 1/3 more than ChonChow but it's definitely at least a 1/3 better in build quality and so much easier/more a pleasure to use (keys and typing feels smooth, solid and not too noisy).First, the negatives -(1) only the mouse usb cord is nicely braided (sturdy) and gold plated.  wish the keyboard's usb cord had the same quality build.(2) once your PC wakes from hibernate, the keyboard goes back to the factory default setting for breathing rainbow lights mode.  It should not do this, it should simply go back to whatever lighting mode you had it before the computer went to sleep.(3)  please add the ability to also turn off the mouse's light, and the lights for both the keyboard and mouse will go to sleep/auto sleep when they are not use for a period of time (like over 10 minutes), or when you put the PC to sleep.(4)  the instruction booklet is VERY minimal - the bare bones way they tell you how to change lighting effect etc. any non expert keyboard gamer would have trouble figuring out.  How do you interpret ""<1>FN+DEL""?  Do you actually need to press the ""<""? etc.?(5) this was shipped to me in its box, unprotected by an outer Amazon box, which is a little worrisome since the mail service can sometimes be rough with packages, and there's not much protecting the keyboard inside except one thin layer of bubble wrap (mine was fine but I'm sure others may get damaged boxes).The GOOD -Reasonable price for overall quality build ($30 for keyboard, mouse and mouse bad).LONG usb cords for mouse and keyboard (they say it's 5 feet long  but seems +6feet!).

B00NLZUM36,"I use my keyboard anywhere from 8-16 hours a day most days.  I work in a dimly lit room at night and need a backlit keyboard that I can see, but doesn't blind me, and that will last.  Others I've had in the past had painted keycaps that would wear off within 6 months to a year.  I purchased a different brand before I bought this one, then gave the other one away because the backlight wouldn't stay on due to an unadvertised ""auto-off"" feature that could not be disabled.This keybaord is perfect for me.  I love the backlight. There are several modes, but I always set it to a single color and choose my preferred brightness.  It's bright enough without being obnoxious, but it can be turned up to be very bright if you wish.  The keys are average height, they are fairly quiet; they do make noise, but it's not the super loud clacky noise that some keyboards make.  The media buttons work well, but are unobtrusive and require no extra drivers or software.I love this keyboard, and my only nitpick is one of style:  Many keys have an alternate function via the function key.  The symbol representing the alternate function is printed at the BOTTOM of each key, meaning the primary function of these keys is printed at the top of the keys.  Due to the angle at which you see the keyboard (since it's in front of you) the bottom half othe keys are better lit than the top of the keys, so the alternate functions show up better than the primary functions of the keys.  For example, on the arrow keys, the alternate functions for backlight brightness are perfectly backlit, while the arrows themselves are dim.  While this is a minor nitpick, I would prefer to have hte primary function on the bottom of the keys with the alternate function printed above.All in all, even with my nitpick I would definitely buy this keyboard again.",Excellent keyboard for gaming or programming,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 8, 2021",True,5.0
B00NLZUM36,"Let me start off by saying the mouse works great, the keyboard however...has a somewhat frustrating issue.During the cooler months, my house usually gets decently cold. I've noticed that when the indoor temperature gets in the low 50s Fahrenheit, some of the keys (those on the left side of the T/G/B keys) won't work in conjunction with the left Shift key. Left Shift will still work with the keys on the other side, and I can still type with the affected keys by themselves in lowercase, but if I hit ""LShift+a"", for example, to capitalize, it won't register any input at all.I write A LOT, so this very quickly became annoying to deal with. After troubleshooting pretty much everything I could think of, unplugging/plugging back in the keyboard, cleaning the keyboard thoroughly, the only explanation I can come up with is that this board just does not like sub-50 degree temps.Otherwise, the keyboard works just fine and is decently comfortable to use.

Why it needs to start in flashing rainbow mode, among others.  But I digress, so far the keyboard has been a great improvement to my situation.The mouse, well, it's in a box on the shelf.  Put bluntly, I don't like it.  I don't like the goofy holes where your thumb rests, I don't like the heavy texture on the buttons.  Unless your thumb and fingers are made of putty or sopping wet, having a smooth rough texture like this does not provide added grip---it provides less surface area contact on your fingers.  That's less grip.  There's a reason race cars use tires with no tread.So unless you're worried about your fingers hydroplaning on your mouse, rough textures really have no place on a mouse.  Unless you're pounding down potato chips while you use your mouse.  I digress.In all seriousness, my dream keyboard would just be the cubicle-ubiquitous Dell Quiet Key, but with keys that illuminate.  I don't care about ghosting.  I don't care about RGB colors. I don't care about multimedia keys or any of that stuff.  This one looked to have fairly generous lower profile keypads rather than the often-imitated IBM model M super tall, skinny keys which I don't like for typing.  And so far, it's been just fine.

It does make a difference, a significant improvement! I used to think I was just a sloppy typist and blamed myself for constantly having to go back and fix words in my sentences. After an hour of typing on this keyboard - I quickly realized that I am a GREAT typist and that my cheap ""dollar store"" quality keyboards I've used in the past were the issue! I found myself flying through emails, never having to look down at the keyboard, and trusting that every letter and number I type would actually work and type as intended. The keys feel great, they are responsive and sensitive, and they all work perfectly.I had no interests in the color changing abilities of the keyboard- I just wanted something functional and high quality. - BUT I will add that the color changing is incredibly easy. I looked at the direction book for 30 seconds and realized I can choose any color I want, I can have rainbow colors, transitioning colors, breathing/fading or turn the lights off/on - the options are all very easily to cycle through by selecting the FN ( function key) and any combination of the (insert) ( home) (end) (delete) (page up) (page down) keys. Its very easy to remember and allows the user to select any number of colors or combinations of colors.These are my first impressions of the keyboard- but I am very impressed and agree with the rest of the 5 star ratings.

Amazon shipped it in it's bare box with no outer box, and of course the box was all dinged up from shipping, and I expected it to be broken, but it was just fine.Even more surprising were my first impressions of the mouse.

I wasn't even expecting to use the mouse, as I have a trackball, I mostly just bought this for the keyboard.I haven't tried the mouse in actual use yet, probably going to give it to a friend, but the keyboard suites my needs very nicely.

I think SHIFT had this problem too. Well, apparently I use shortcuts involving those control keys a lot, as a professional software engineer.I'm pretty sure it has to do with the anti-conflict mechanism they setup. Notice the keys on the left side of the keyboard that are underlined. I think those are all part of this group. On the back of the box, it says ""25-key rollover"".So like, with VS Code for example, if I try to enter a 3-key combo in the shortcut key mapper, it will only take two keys from the left side of the keyboard.So, I'm not a gamer, and maybe this is somehow good for gaming, I don't know; but I kind of doubt it. I would recommend look elsewhere.I can say a couple good things about the keyboard. I did like the light settings they had. They weren't too bad. I also like the key layout. I don't like where they put the volume keys. They should have made dedicated media keys for those. For me, I only use the volume media keys on keyboards; I don't use any of the other media keys. Although I do think the track control keys are nice to have (play/pause, next/prev).I like the fact that it has lights to show Caps Lock and Num Lock. I guess its nice to have ""Win Lock"" if that's something you can do; but I've never heard of it. Maybe that's for Scroll Lock?I would almost give this a 3, but like I said, the wonkiness with the control keys is a deal breaker for me.

The main issue I have is that it always resets itself to the rainbow nonsense every time you turn your computer off and back on.

My hands are a little on the dry side.  I bought this keyboard, because I thought it was a good deal for an ergonomic keyboard and did not really pay too much attention to the gaming aspect of it.  It has flashing lights that are kind of annoying, but if you read the instruction manual you can adjust them to a single color, flashing and non-flashing or no light at all.  It is very hard to see without a light, though.  Not sure how it will work at night, but I think it will work nicely and in that regard I think it offers something not on my previous keyboard.  In daytime hours it is hard to see the keys, as the characters are not painted on, but are rather are see through .  I would not recommend for anyone  looking for an ergonomic keyboard.  At first I was unhappy with it, but once I figured how to adjust the lights I am okay with it and are actually happy I can use it at night without additional lighting.  The fact that it came with a mouse is an additional bonus, so yeah I would buy again for the price, but I think if I could fight an ergonomic keyboard for the same price I would buy ergonomic.",Good Night Time Use,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020",True,4.0

B00NLZUM36,"I bought this combination, expecting it to work out of the box. The Keyboard is beautiful and does a fine job of working for what I intend it for. The mouse... No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.One more item: Redragon makes it VERY clear that software is included with this package. It is most certainly NOT. And they go to great lengths to hide the software from the end user. I have found what I believe to be the software links, but plan to test before I share them here. I will bump up the review one notch if the package works out well over the long haul, but given the mouse issue right out of the gate and the promised software NOT being in the box plus the poor web site support to find the program, I cannot reasonably give Redragon a 5 star rating until these items are corrected.Update: December 2019 - I was able to correct all the issues with that first mouse and the software works just fine. I've since bought this combination of mouse and keyboard 3 more times and had no issues. This truly is a great keyboard/mouse combination and I've made it a standard setup on the 3 gaming systems I've built to date.  Software is indeed on their website but it is a little strange to find - The mouse is on the website as ""Redragon M601-3 CENTROPHORUS 3200 DPI Gaming Mouse "" and has two downloadable executables - The Windows 10 version works just fine.

B00NLZUM36,"I bought the keyboard + mouse set as an upgrade from my previous keyboard. I had an old emachines keyboard that I dearly loved, but the print has worn off many keys and some of the keys take considerable pressure to function, so it was time to upgrade. I will be using this for coding and extensive word processing, not gaming, so that's what this review is based on.Mouse: The mouse is nice. It's got a nice weight. The texture on the buttons gives it a good feel. It glides on the mousepad well with no skips. It's plug-and-play, although you need the driver in order to program the extra buttons. (see below) I haven't used the DPI switch, since I wont' need this for my work. The funny little contour points at the back end of the mouse are quite handy for moving the mouse around when selecting large amounts of text. No noticeable delay between click and computer response.Keyboard: The keyboard is ok. I'm kind of a ""banger"" when it comes to typing (I press hard on the keys as I type.) But this keyboard makes considerably less noise than my last keyboard... much softer sound and keypress (if that makes any sense). I was hoping to have the static rainbow illumination for the backlight, but haven't figured out how to do that yet. (see below) My biggest complaint is that it's missing the little notches on the ""J"" key that I used to use to orient my fingers when I begin typing. It has a notch on the ""F"" and the ""5"" on the tenkeys area, but not on the ""J"".Instructions: This is where this set really fails. A very thick booklet is included with this set, but don't get excited. Most of the book is translations. There's only about 3-5 pages of instructions, in very small print (I needed to get a magnifier to read them!), and the instructions aren't complete. The instructions could be written with more clarity about how to change colors, and the website for downloading drivers isn't even listed. AND when you do Google-search and find the website, you'll find that the model number on the booklet (and mouse & keyboard) isn't the same as the one on the website. (If you read the Q&A for this item, you'll see what I mean.)Overall, the instructions are the worst problem with this item. If you can get beyond this, it's not a bad set for the price.

B00NLZUM36,"Initial findings.I love the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù brushed coating on the keyboard it feels nice and over all is very comfortable ergonomically when typing. The keys have good resistance, footprint and travel. They feel like I‚Äôm actually hitting keys vs buttons like some smaller keyboards.The lighting effects are fun with a wide range of settings and can turn them off or dim them as needed with a couple keystrokes. Over all a solid buy for the cost.As for the mouse, while not the main reason I bought this setup, it seems like a mild afterthought. The plastic is hard and stiff making it feel like it wasn‚Äôt finished, the components like buttons, edging and grips are uneven making it feel like it was put together wrong, the weight and over all feel reminds me of a cheap generic stock mouse you would find in a computer lab or office that came with the dell still running windows 7, that‚Äôs made to barely serve a purpose. and nothing more. The finish is textured to give a better grip, but unlike the soft almost silicon texture of the keyboard, the surface feels hard and abrasive. Even the ‚Äúsilicon‚Äù grips feel like hard plastic.I do appreciate the sensitivity toggle option for the curser. Having duel screens and a higher sensitivity is amazingly helpful. But every time the computer is put to sleep or turned off cutting power to the mouse the setting goes back to the low sensitivity default so every time I have to reset it.Finally my biggest complaint and the reason for the 4 star review is the mouse is so loud and clicky I cant use the mouse with any open mics because it will wash out any other sound coming through.Over all if you just need a solid keyboard or need a mouse and keyboard combo for general use.

First the color started to look really odd on the keyboard, like 1/2 would be blue and 1/2 green.  Then keys stopped working.  Now the lights are complete dead.  As it is not a keyboard with painted letters/numbers (the lights were how you saw them) it is virtually useless to me.  I can't see what I'm typing in a dark room or even dimly lit one.  None of the arrow keys work at all either.  Like I said, it was used daily but never harshly.  It never fell.  It's been sitting in front of my computer and I type with it.  I don't even game with it, as my job is too demanding to leave me time for that.  The mouse is still working great....but come on.  10 months before it breaks?

My theory has always been why would I pay $50+ for a mouse and keyboard that I will just break or replace in a years time, just to have fancy RGB lighting, when I can get a basic one that suits my needs for a sliver of the price.  I was right, but wrong!  You can have both.  This set is the same price as buying a basic (walmart ie...) type mouse or keyboard for the same price, and you get the flashy RGB. The mouse even has a DPI option which you wont find with most basic mouses out there.It looks great, for me they are also both comfortable and fits my fingers well.The keyboards RGB is easy to figure out, but the mouse is a little different. It defaults with red and while some say you can download software to change this, I have seen others say its only red in this model. I have yet to do so as I'm fine with the red.  The mouse software is listed under a different model number on the manufacturers website, so keep that in mind if you care enough to go hunt it down and try it out.

B00NLZUM36,"This keyboard and mouse combo is a killer deal for the price.  I bought this as a temporary keyboard and mouse as I'm doing a gaming PC/music production/game development work horse.  I was extremely surprised and impressed with the mouse especially.  I play CSGO mainly (as it is all I can run on this laptop) and I usually don't fair all that well, I'm usually 1:1 on my K/D ratio and within the first 3 games I went well over 2:1 and a significant jump in overall kills using this mouse and keyboard combo.  Point being I haven't changed anything about my game play and so from a scientific perspective, this mouse and keyboard setup made all the difference in the world.  The mouse fits well in the palm of your hand and has a nice texture for solid gripping during long game sessions.The accuracy of this mouse is incredible for the price, actually not just for the price, it's just that this is an incredible value for the money.  This may end up being a permanent keyboard and mouse for my gaming PC after all.The keyboard is as advertised, RGB back lit and color changing with various options including the ability to choose one solid color.  I actually like the ""spectrum"" color shifting and I also love the ability to maintain a solid color.  The keys are very quiet (not clacky like a mechanical keyboard) and this is due to the membrane style rather than individual switches like a higher end keyboard such as Razer.  I'm not saying this is better or even comparing just letting you know this is NOT a mechanical keyboard, if that is your preference do not buy this.  I prefer the silence of the keys and they are extremely responsive, even while gaming.It's to be seen as to how long this combo will last but even if I only get a year out of it, at less than $30, it's still a solid deal.P.S. The mouse I'm currently using is a wireless BlackWeb and it's about $6 here on Amazon, I actually purchased it from Best Buy about two years ago, and it's fine for an all around mouse but for gaming, you definitely need something better such as this combo.  The BlackWeb has a rating of 1600DPI I believe and if I remember correctly this one is double that at it's highest setting and it's noticeable.

Some I've loved and some I've hated.This pair is somewhere in the middle.The keyboard is lightweight but doesn't feel too flimsy. Giving it a twist shows it has some flexibility but no creaking or popping. It uses the typical 104 key style layout with no odd-shaped keys. The cord is straight and vinyl insulated. There are the usual additional multimedia keys (No audio volume?) that so many manufacturers like to tout as a feature and that nobody uses. RGB lighting is controlled by the keyboard rather than the computer and has a number of options. It's bright enough to see the keys in a darkened room except for the multimedia keys, which are not lighted.The mouse is the biggest disappointment for me. The pointer jumps and wanders while used in games which has been a huge cause of frustration for me to the point I'll be replacing it. (I've tried six different surfaces with the results being the same) The cable is stiff and fabric covered in red highlites which doesn't match the keyboard. The mouse is lighted in RED only with a 'breathing' effect, so you can't match it to your keyboard or system color scheme. The weight system is still too light with no option for additional weights.

The cord to the keyboard feels like it could last a while.Personal opinion (like all of this...): the mouse is the best part of this combo. Its a 6 button mouse (2 ""regular"" mouse buttons, 1 button on the click wheel, 1 just above the click wheel that changes the DPI settings, and 2 buttons in the right hand thumb location.) The mouse has red lights that breath by default (though you can turn this off through somewhat glitchy software that works 1/2 the time. But your hand is covering it when you use it...so it'll probably be ok). The USB cord has a braided jacket that feels like it can take alot. It has a weight system that you can customize (personally I use 1 of the weights for a lighter feeling mouse). I have large hands and am right handed, and I like that the mouse fits my hand well. The thumb buttons on the mouse are closer to the desk than some other mice I've used. I use a photo manipulation program often with it and the ability to set DPI higher at the click of a button is pretty useful. It also comes in handy when you run out of space on the desk (because sometimes I have papers, electronics projects etc. that are also on the desk)I'm curious how long the mouse and keyboard will last (I've had them for just under a month with daily 2-3 hour use at the time of writing this).

B00NLZUM36,"I've only been using it since yesterday, but I am already won over by this keyboard and mouse combo. Now, the M601-3 Centrophorus mouse is great. It's heavy, glides smoothly, the buttons are responsive, and the size is just right for my hands. That alone is worth the money, but I'm not focusing on the mouse in this review, but the keyboard.This keyboard is a delight. Typing on it is comfortable, the keys are sturdy, give a nice tactile response, and aren't so loud as to wake sleeping members of the household as I type. There was a time when I could type 130 WPM with zero errors, but for years that number was severely reduced due to a number of issues: carpal tunnel, arthritis, and poorly made keyboards. Right now I'm typing around 110 WPM with zero errors, and the keyboard isn't even breaking a sweat. This is probably the best it will ever get for me, but I am already amazed. I never thought I'd be able to type this fast ever again, but the keyboard is laid out in such a way, with the keys themselves offering a terrific response that lets my fingers bounce from one key to another without any interference or lag, that I don't even feel like I'm straining at keeping up the pace.I realize this isn't a mechanical keyboard, but it does feel like one. I mean, if you can't afford a mechanical keyboard, the Redragon Harpe K503RGB is a fantastic deal, and I haven't even got to the fun part yet: the lights!As you know from the description, the keyboard lights up in a rainbow pattern, as well as 7 colors, including my two favorites: purple, and white. It also has a spectrum option which shows a steady rainbow that doesn't blink, or you can have one that ""breathes."" It's all rather lovely, and it's a dream for me to type at night. I touch type, but sometimes you need to see the keys, even in the dark, and I have no trouble seeing where my hands are placed, or where I'm going while I'm typing at night.All in all, I got this combo for a steal. $30? It's easily worth twice that much, IMO. As a budget gamer, I never thought I'd be able to afford a keyboard and mouse with this kind of quality. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a lot of money, but would like to be productive as a gamer, as a typist, and as a general computer user.5 out of 5 Stars.

B00NLZUM36,ok first off I did not buy this for gaming i needed a new keyboard because a cat decided that my keyboard was a great place to cough up a hairball on my keyboard and I work from home.  well after the dogs ate the hairball off the keys I found the left over mess and got to work.  After popping off the keys and doing a  cleaning the L P and space bar were all sticking.  like it took me 5 min to type the word approve because of that letter P.  So i ordered this keyboard 1. the price. 2. the pretty lights on the keys and 3 it could be shipped the next day and work wouldn't be that interrupted.So I get the keyboard after struggling at work all day I excitedly connected it and tested it out. and OMG the letters G and M were not responding on the new key board....(insert allot of screaming yelling temper tantrum and foul language)  I set up for an exchange with amazon the next morning they told me my replacement would take 2 days... I couldn't do it... I cancelled the replacement logged into best buy and ordered the same keyboard from them but I was able to pick it up the same day on my lunch hour.I got the exact same keyboard I had ordered for the same price and EVERYTHING works beautifully!  the only issue is i wish the keyboard was more to the right but that's more of how my work space is set up than the item.  So I'm giving this keyboard 3 starts because the first one I had was faulty but the 2nd one works great.. but remember I am not gaming just data entry so I do not need the speed of a gaming keyboard so it wouldn't really be fair for me to comment on that.,keys didn't work,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021",True,3.0
B00NLZUM36,"I LOVE this keyboard. It's absolutely perfect. Now, I've always been a PC gamer, but I've never purchased a gaming keyboard or mouse. . My first keyboard was just a plain black Logitech keyboard that I've owned for five years, and my mouse was a trackball. Now see, I've always wanted a keyboard that glows. The Alienware keyboards looked so beautiful with the ability to customize the colors. But I guess I decided..Why do I need that? I've been typing ever since I was a child. I have the locations of every key memorized. I don't even have to look down anymore. Eventually, I found the mouse and figured I'd give it a try. My finger was just getting ready to hit ""Proceed to checkout"" when all of a sudden, I saw this combo.So I figured..Why not kill two birds with one stone?The set finally arrived after a dramatic week of waiting. I'll tell you right now..When I opened the box from Amazon, and pulled out the case, I was absolutely ecstatic! After I opened the box, I spent a good ten minutes admiring the set, clicking the mouse, and feeling it in my hands. The braided cord was an excellent touch I've never seen attempted before. But when I plugged the keyboard and mouse in, I knew that I was inlove with this set. The product images don't do well to represent the backlight. It's a lot brighter than I expected, which I love(Remember, I wanted a keyboard with glowing keys). But the mouse has the best glow to it! Anyway, it has three DPI settings on the mouse which has proven very helpful in FPS games. And it has two side buttons, which I haven't experimented with yet, BUT I notice that either them act as a ""Go back one page"" and ""Go forward one page"". Even more convenient is that I can open a new tab in Firefox by clicking the scroll wheel.I have to get used to the raised keys, as well as using a mouse instead of a trackball. And of course, there are the numerous multimedia keys. The ""enter' button is a bit farther like the others have mentioned, but I honestly don't find that a con. It's something that I immediately got used to upon using it.In conclusion, I love it. I thought I'd immediately regret this purchase, but I just don't.

This is one flashy keyboard, the solid backlight setting is great, especially gaming in low-light. I still have attempted the ""changes color with each keystroke"" but would likely be a strobe effect.Warning: There is no downloadable software, all the settings are manually done at the Keyboard or Mouse. The only reason I can't give it a 5-star. This is why it is a good entry level gaming setup. No macros to program, it would be up to the game to keymap, but macros are out. The DPI setting on the mouse resets each time you shutdown/restart the computer, so you just need to click the DPI selection button. Same goes with the Keyboard, the FN Home, or FN END will change the backlighting. The instructions have a page on which each does.I'm not a fan of the ""no memory"" aspect of the keyboard and mouse, but the cable length, funcitionality and feel of the keyboard, a well weighted full sized mouse. Oh, cable length is good to longer than expected, I think about 5'. The mouse cable is braided.It's really not a bad set, I might get one of ReDragon's higher end KB/Mouse over the more ""common"" brands out there.

B00NLZUM36,"This keyboard and mouse work. They're perfectly serviceable. The light options on the keyboard are nice. That's the extent of the good things I can say about this set, unfortunately.To start with, the mouse. I thought I was getting a five-button gaming mouse (not including scroll wheel): I did not. The two side buttons are MACRO playback buttons that require Redragon's propriety and obviously-machine-translated software to function. The macro function sucks because it doesn't have good manual editing; you cannot type in a set of instructions to push X button at Y time, etc, etc, the way you could with AutoHotKey. You have to record all the keystrokes in the correct order and manually edit the timing/delete anything. But you cannot add!You CAN assign the side buttons - and, for that matter, the regular Mouse1 and Mouse2 buttons - to other keys. However, you CANNOT simply assign them to, say, Mouse3 or Mouse4, as those options are anomalously missing. You may only assign it to Left or Right Mouse, or a bunch of special windows keys like IE Forward/Back, Multimedia, Mouse1/Mouse2, Internet Explorer special keys, and the like.The middle button, below the mousewheel and between the left and right mouse keys, is not a mouse button! ALL it does is swap between one of four programmable mouse input DPI steps. This seems mostly superflous to me, as you can set the mouse's DPI in the software. I wouldn't mind so much if ""switch between DPI settings"" was an OPTION and I could reclaim that button for, say, Mouse5, but nope! That is absolutely, positively ALL it does.The keyboard has some FANCY light options, I'll give it that. The instruction book is reasonably helpful at explaining them all, too. Annoyingly, they're only a set of input-based options from the keyboard's own function key, and NOT programmable via the software - which has nothing at all to do with the keyboard. Furthermore, the mouse only has one color - red - and you can only choose between light on, light off, and if it is on, change the speed of the mouse light's breathing. These products are obviously not made as partners, they're just two different products manufactured by the same company and sold as a set.The keyboard, also, feels cheap. See also the damage on the S, D, N, M, and . keys in my picture above. I have only had this keyboard about six months (arrived mid-April 2019, photograph taken mid-September 2019, day before the date-of-posting since midnight has just passed as I am typing this,) and it's already visibly worn from use. This is the kind of keyboard that's made to be unboxed immediately before a PC gaming pro sets down for a tournament, it doesn't feel like it's going to stand up to two decades of wear and still be functional the way my last keyboard was - and still is, though filthy and with many keys worn physically through. I bought this combo for the mouse, which, speaking of cheapness;The mouse is also bloody cheap, too. It FEELS nice and solid and thunky and heavy in your hand - that's because there's a bloody great mass of sodding metal weights inside it! You can pull them out to adjust their spacing and numbering if you like, so that's nice I guess, but with them all out, if just looks feels like a generic Logitech corded mouse going through a Goth phase.In conclusion, they work, they're cheap enough and if you like ""gaming"" stuff, or dragons, or black, or colors, or fancy rainbow cycling lights and you need to replace either or both of a keyboard or mouse, they'll do the job.

I was WRONG about:- This keyboard (S101-3) DOES NOT have supported software.- The lighting controls are done from the keyboard itself.SO when I plugged this keyboard and immediately the keyboard started streaming colors across the keys...WHAT IS GOING ON. This should NOT be the default. Anyways, I looked online for software, but there is none. Then I tried to use the lighting controls on the keyboard and could not figure it out. I had to pull out the manual (see pictures) and I'm copying it here for reference. Hopefully this helps you like it helped me.So there IS a way to choose solid colors. And there IS a way to cycle through colors WITHOUT breathing (which I prefer).Cons:- No software- Confusing when first using.Pros:- QUIET. I know this is a mesh keyboard, but man is this so much quieter than my mechanical keyboard.- LOTS of buttons. I kinda geek out a little about all the options to control things from the push of a button right from the keyboard and this has lots of that.So even though I just started using this I think it will grow on me.

The red lights looks good on both the keyboard and mouse but aren't too bright.

After putting in about 200 hours of CS:GO using this keyboard and mouse set up, I feel like I've put it through it's paces. The only issue that I've come up with was binding keys to the mouse buttons 4 and 5. They're a little tough only because instead of using the options menu I had to manually type in the binds through the console. Other than that I've had no issues. The Keyboard is a bit on the louder side but not much more than any mechanical keyboard albeit much louder than a chiclet keyboard would be, but that's to be expected. As far as how noisy it is when I'm gaming, since I'm really only using WASD a bit of the shift key and then tab, I haven't had much noise. The most important thing is that the wife doesn't get annoyed with the noise so there's that. 200 hours later this is still a 5 star extreme bang for the buck keyboard/mouse setup.",Just like anything else that you buy through Amazon Prime this ...,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 8, 2016",True,5.0

This is 100% my fault for not noticing before purchase, but it's rather annoying because my computer follows a green theme, and I have a red mouse that clashes with my color scheme. Also, any time the keyboard or mouse is unplugged or if I shut down or restart my computer, the keyboard and mouse completely reset. This includes anything from the lighting settings on the keyboard to the DPI speed of the mouse. For me, it's a rather minor and petty inconvenience that takes all of ten seconds to fix, but it's still a little annoying, and I don't give five stars that easily.Overall, I think that this is a decent keyboard and mouse set that I plan to use for quite a while.",Not Bad For the Price,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 3, 2020",True,4.0

With the key cap remover, it wouldn't be hard to clean it up.Original post 7/24/2015:Pros:-Budget price-Durable-LEDs are nice and not overly bright-Has a matte texture on the keys and mouse that I personally like-Splash resistant-Braided wires-Wires are a good lengthCons:-Mouse needs a mouse pad; not accurate on some surfaces-Keyboard is a bit glossy under certain lighting-LEDs on keyboard and mouse don't have on/off setting-Not back lit-Enter key is shortOther notes:I'm your occasional gamer, looking for quality and durability but minding the price. I bought this set because I was looking into a new keyboard, and I was going to give my old Sharkk mouse to my brothers so I needed a new mouse too. The high reviews got to me so I gave into this keyboard (red LEDs going with my Corsair SPEC-01 case), but personally I was not impressed much. I think the cons I listed like the LEDs, the mouse, and the enter key made me rethink my purchase (I knew these things upon reading the reviews, but bought it anyways because I didn't know my preferences yet). I've adjusted to the enter key already, and I have a mouse pad, but these are just FYIs.Personally if I could go back I would've dished out $50-60 for a separate full size keyboard and mouse. If this can last me over a year I'll be fine with it though.

B00NLZUM36,"Honestly, there's not a lot to say about this keyboard and mouse combo. For the most part, it's a no frills combo that will get the job done for us gamers on a budget. I've been using the combo to play extended sessions of Ring of Elysium, and I haven't missed a beat.Keyboard feels great to type on, and has a decent sound when keys are pressed, which is satisfying. I really like the RBG as well.The mouse is fairly light, even with the weights installed. But it feels very precise and smooth. I also enjoy that there's a program to download that lets you do some small customization such as setting up macros, changing DPI (up to 3200), and changing the speed of the breathing affect for the red LED.Overall, this is a basic, and inexpensive, solution for PC gaming. Hard to go wrong.UPDATE 12/36/18:Took me some time to get around to making this update. Life has been a bit of a pain lately, but it hasn't stopped me just yet.Anyway, I had an issue just a month or two ago, in which a bowl of cereal spilled all over my keyboard. In a panic, I dove under my desk, and unplugged it. I then promptly took it to my kitchen sink, and ran it under some water to help clean out the milk. This is when I noticed the holes on the bottom. I hadn't realized that this keyboard is liquid resistance, but I was sure glad because I really wanted a milk-free keyboard experience.Just to stay safe, I went ahead and let the keyboard sit and dry, with a fan pointed directly on it, for a couple of weeks.I'm happy to say that, after it had time to dry, and I finished cleaning up any dried milk left behind, the keyboard is functioning as well as it did out of the box.Good going Redragon!

B00NLZUM36,"I bought this keyboard and mouse a little over a year ago, and since then it has held up nicely. For the keyboard (at first) the keys were a bit hard to push down (even after time had passed), but eventually I wore them down (I guess they were stiff due to lack of use). The keys have a nice feel, and not cheap like something else you'd buy at this price. As for the mouse, it's actually pretty comfortable when using. I game quite a lot (and as it is currently Summer, all the more), and I was looking for a nice keyboard and mouse where I could feel comfortable, type fast and easy, and swiftly and cleanly move my hand two and fro. What I really enjoy about the mouse is the fact that there are adjustable weights in the bottom. You can easily screw and unscrew the bottom cap, and take out as much weight as you want from the mouse, to give it a more light feel. Now, don't get me wrong, the mouse isn't heavy at all when it's at it's default weight, it's about as heavy as any average mouse you have or will use in your life. SIDE BUTTONS - I (as a PC gamer) always enjoy a couple of side buttons to bind to certain commands or chat messages, and this mouse came with 2 extra side buttons, which is awesome, especially for the price.I'd say this keyboard and mouse combo is good for the price. The reason I did not put an entire 5 stars for my review is due to the angle the keyboard is. It may be just me, but, say, with the Razer keyboards, a few of them have a flat-ish, hardly-angled front to them, where you can easily rest your wrists, and with this keyboard I can't comfortably wrest my wrists down on the keyboard's edge, but that's just me being OCD.

That caused a bit of confusion.Secondly; the DPI toggle is one button. Most gaming mice have 2 buttons to toggle the DPI up and down on the fly. With a 1 button setup, if I am on Setting 2 (1200 DPI) and want to switch to Setting 1 (600 DPI), I cannot toggle UP. I have to go through Settings 3, 4, & 5, and THEN back to 1.That's pretty bad, given that gaming in fist-person shooters is frequently done with a high DPI to look around, then a low DPI to precisely aim. With my old, $20 mouse, I could toggle up and down. With this mouse, I have to frantically mash the DPI toggle to get back to a lower setting.Secondly: Other programmable mouse I have had frequently have different colors for different DPI settings.This mouse has one tiny strip-light that flashes at different speeds, just below the toggle button...In the center of the mouse...Where your hand will be covering it. If you look in the picture, the DPI toggle button looks like a chevron/ arrow pointing down at the light that flashes.Just two horrible design choices that make the mouse pretty lousy for gaming.But at least the keyboard is nice and quiet and feels nice to use.And the mouse feels nice in my hand.

I've upgraded their rating to 3 stars because the design and look of the keyboard & mouse was cool and they obviously stand behind their products and did their best to try and appease me.

B00NLZUM36,"After looking at RGB keyboards from reputable brands, I noticed the REDRAGON combination set to be one of the more purchased sets on the lower budget spectrum. I liked the weight, style and design of both keyboard and mouse; however, when I received my set, I'm questioning if I should have payed the extra money to get set from a more reputable brand.KEYS - half of the keys on my keyboard function perfectly. I have no problems with any of the smaller keys, such as the ""q"", ""w"", ""e"", ""r"", ""t"" ect. or other keys that are of this size, but any of the larger keys, such as the 0, Enter, and + keys on the number pad , the ""shift"" keys, backspace and backslash all have different resistances or don't function properly. They are difficult to press, or do not register when pressed. Half of the time, when the backspace character is pressed the ""="" sign is entered because of a poor manufacture molding. - Poor quality control, should not have left the factory. Refer to the picture about the fused keys.RGB - REDGRAGON will receive a star for this. For the cost of the board, the RGB functionality is perfect. It is very easy to navigate through the different RGB settings by using the function key, paired with (insert|home|pageup|pagedown|delete) ect. I also like that the media keys functioned properly without the need of additional driver installation.Drivers - I think that it is poor that REDGRAGON states the compatibility of operating systems in the instruction manual but does not provide the download, or its address in the instruction manual or packaging to receive the ""programmable buttons"" functionality.  -1 star for this reason. False advertisement. I still haven't found the software.Weight - The keyboard doesn't feel cheap, and neither does the mouse. They are of the higher quality ( at least material density) from what I would expect of something within this price range. Both the keyboard and mouse are finished with a matte/gloss finish. The mouse is ergonomic in the hand, but has enough weight to hold against the pull of the chord. This was a very nicely balanced design. The mouse also features adjustable counterweights, which is perfect to get the response you need in FPS shooters.Mouse - REDGRAGON gets a star for this -- the color, shape, design and functionality are flawless ( at least with the one I received ). The dpi switcher functions exactly as described, providing instant response during gameplay, or while casually browsing on the operating system. The side buttons have a very crispy click, but aren't difficult to press. I would say it feels ""snappy"" when being used. The chord that comes with it is very lengthy, and made out of a material that seems it will last. I have nothing bad to say here, other than the fact that I can't program what I want to it because of the drivers.Summary 2.5/5 starsI don't purchase myself technology gifts very often, so when I do, I want them to function the as advertised. I think REDGRAGON should reassess its quality control measures to provide the customer with a better product. This keyboard combination set has the potential to be 5/5, but not when half of the set doesn't function as intended. I think I'm going to return this.

The backlight worked as soon as we plugged it in, hence the plug and play claim. The mouse is also smooth, responsive, and fast. I am not sure if anyone else encountered this, but we were unsure of how to change the backlight colors, we thought it did need a driver but found through sheer luck that to change the colors and variations use the ""FN"" key and press the insert, home, page up, delete, end or page down keys.

Initially I really enjoyed typing on this keyboard due to the grippy ruber texture, but that wore away quickly... like within a month. Also, after 3 months, some of the letter keys started to wear away. Also, the RGB settings on the keyboard started randomly resetting about month 4. I have a dual boot (linux/windows) desktop plus a work laptop, all sharing this keyboard via a switch. It's possible that this contributed to the RGB  resets, but I doubt it.The Mouse, on the other hand, is pretty dope.

    ¬†The big thing I want to say, that for the price you get a pretty good looking RGB keyboard that seems to be in pretty decent quality and could be help up to par to any other decent RGB keyboard in the $50 price range. The keys feel smooth to touch, and although I don't how they will feel overtime they just feel great to type on. The little wrist holder feels nice to use I just wish the little designs on it weren't there but it's still good! For some reason the logo and the top of  the keyboard looks different than in the images shown on the page, but it's not a big change and it looks good! The mouse is a pretty basic mouse in the price range, has all of it's buttons and an amazing braided color. The coolest thing are the little weights in the back that make the mouse feel good and weighty to use, and not floaty like plastic mouses you'd expect to see in the $30 price range. You can take the weights out if you want and get the feel you want but I feel like all the weights are just nice! All and all, a perfect bang for your buck product and if you got the cash, I think this is a pretty safe buy. I have had no issues yet, but will update this review if I get any.

B00NLZUM36,"It does what it's supposed to do, although I have some complaints about the keyboard.1. The right shift key is sticky.  In my case, that means that it feels like it's cushioned when I press it, keeping it from making that trademark keyboard clicking noise that we all know and love, and make it take noticeably longer to return to the ""unpressed"" position after having pressed it. It makes me think of those doors with air pistons of them, where no matter how hard you close or slam it, the piston slows it down to keep it from slamming hard. This may just be a lubrication issue, or perhaps something wrong with the rubber, but it's still annoying. Even worse, the only way I was able to remove the shift key to try and see what the problem was, was to remove the CTRL key under it, so I could have space to insert a gift card under the shift key to pry it up.  After that, the CTRL key is also sticky. This makes me further suspect lubrication issues.  But this process leads me into my next complaint2. It didn't come with a key-remover device, or whatever you call the little plastic tool that fits around individual keys to remove them.  I have to use a plastic card from my wallet to remove keys, which is necessary to do when they don't work right.  Having the little tool would have made things a heck of a lot simpler.3. I know of no way to change the lighting sequence.  Sure, you can slow the rainbow of colors down, or turn it off, but I don't know of any way to just have a single solid color show, which is preferable when working or gaming at night and you don't want a constantly changing light source under your nose.As for some backstory, I got this keyboard and mouse as compensation after the PC I ordered didn't include a keyboard like it was supposed to.

They're also easy to distinguish between.There is a speed adjuster right below the wheel, two set, and then an off.

Pretty inexpensive gaming keyboard and great for casual and amateur gamers. The keyboard and mouse are both wired and need a USB port to connect. The keyboard is lightweight because of the plastic casing. Multiple features on the keyboard like a play and pause button, volume up/down Fn keys, PrintScreen key, and other fun keys.

Don't have much to complain about it.As I game often, the space bar and WASD keys are rubbing off their matte coat as well as the click buttons on the mouse and I had this product for only a little over a week. The only issue is that this model comes with a membrane switch key type, not mechanical keys. I really wished the product description specified that in a more obvious way.

It won't get slick in a sweaty palm during intense gaming! My one big complaint is that they made the plastic on the USB connectors so thick that the keyboard and mouse can't be plugged into adjacent USB ports on my motherboard. I may shave them down, but this seems like a serious design fail for a set that comes together.

And he is SUPER rough with his electronics, so this speaks VOLUMES about the quality of this product. (I can‚Äôt tell you how many headsets we have run through over the past 2 years.) Both devices still light up, and there have been no issues with functionality. All the keys on the keyboard are still in tact, no sticking, even the characters on the keys are still fully visible. My son complains about the keys being too loud during gameplay, but not much else. The mouse has full functionality as well - the scroll wheel still tracks, all buttons still work.

The keys aren't loose and have a solid feel when you depress them and the rgb colours are vibrant and illuminate well. There are many different colours you can set the backlights to which is neat. The whole board is light but feels solid and not cheap by any means.

I have small hands and short fingers. I usually use compact mice because I use a claw grip. I cannot do that with this mouse because of the size. This would be perfect for someone with a larger size hand. I do love the dpi button and the weight customization. The mouse registers lighter pressure than other mice I use and I really like that.

B00NLZUM36,"So, what do I like about this set? Not a SINGLE thing. The mouse began to malfunction within about 10 days, and proved to be worthless for regular PC use, and even more useless of low level games ( like those on POGO) so for it to be promoted as a ""gaming set"" is absurd. (unless annoying flashing lights equals good performance in the eyes of gamers) It doesn't track and clicking is fairly hit and miss. About 1/3 of the times when you click it does nothing, and the side buttons are hair trigger and they shut screens and change where you are at the lightest brush. As of the AM it is in a thousand pieces, because the only pleasure I have gotten out of this POS waste of plastic was stomping it into  oblivion after it closed out and lost a document when I brushed on of those side buttons with my thumb while trying to make the cursor move. If I could go punch the person who developed this POS in the mouth, I'd fly to China to do it. The keyboard is a whole 'nother thing...It is designed for people with very tiny hands apparently, and anyone with a sizable reach, who was trained on a typical/standard keyboard, will make constant typing mistakes...and honestly, the whole color thing is just freaking annoying, and you have to manually set it to the least annoying setting every time you restart your computer. Who needs that? Maybe a teenager who doesn't have anything real to accomplish on a computer, but not a normal human who has actual work to do. Beyond that, some keys you really have to strike fairly hard to make the keystroke register, other times if you brush the top of a button as you are moving around the keyboard to type, it will register that keystroke, so spelling mistake are an every single minute occurrence unless one types in the same manner as I was taught in High School typing class ( every keystroke performed with hands hovering about an inch over the keyboard, and my hands in full secretarial position.) I bought this POS set January 24, and today is April 27th, and I bought it because it had such high ratings for usability, and the price was decent...I wasn't expecting it to last more than a year or so, because that seems to be about the length of time and any keyboard and mouse will last these days, even with just average use. This POS lasted 3 months ( okay, I might have gotten another week out of it had I not taken the extreme pleasure of smashing the mouse...and the Keyboard is next as soon as I can shop in person for a new one that hopefully won't be yet another piece of crap) If it were possible to leave a negative rating for this crap set, I absolutely would.","Very literally the most worthless, cheapest, crappiest mouse and keyboard set I have ever used.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 27, 2020",True,1.0

I want to compare it to a truck's bed liner for texture. The shortcut function keys work surprisingly well. It was a little smaller than expected but that worked out for the better. The lights also are not too bright, it's just in the sweet spot for me. The spacebar kinda squeeks sometimes, but you only hear it if you're listening for it.Mouse: Weighted well. Love having a DPI button finally. Looks very cool, even without the lights on. Haven't used the extra thumb buttons in games yet, but they work in webpages so they are definitely functional. My only gripe (hence the 4 stars) is how the mouse wheel annoyingly will go the opposite way when you do a longer scroll. To elaborate, when you're skimming a website, scrolling down at average speed, it will go back up for one of the scrolls. It's only a little thing, but oh my lord it's annoying. Especially when you just need to scroll down one notch and it's like ""Nope, I'm gonna go up instead."" Grr.Other than the mouse wheel, everything is working perfectly and not falling apart.

They have a nice feedback and bounce when pressed, with a lightweight feel while not feeling cheap-The lights on set is nice, but not overly distracting. Never had a keyboard/mouse with colored lights on them. Its a cool aesthetic but I could see if overdone it would be annoying.-(THIS IS A PRO FOR ME, MAYBE A CON FOR YOU) They keys are small. I have long, but thin fingers so many times the keys feel a little clunky in reach. Not on this bad boy. If you have mad meat hands though this thing will feel like a kids keyboard.Cons:-Mouse driver isn't mac compatible which just means I had to download a third party driver to set up hotkeys for my games. Not a huge deal and honestly still worth the price.Overall, if you are looking for a nice, quality, entry level gaming keyboard and mouse this is definitely the setup to go with. The more I use the things the more I friggen love them.EDIT: (12/31) So after a couple months using this set I can honestly say I still love the keyboard. The mouse on the other hand....well that has developed a bit of a latancy issue in part of the scroll wheel which is more than a bit annoying. I've taken a star off because of this (now its rated ""just ok"" at 3 stars.)

If you search S101-3, there are no software downloads. I eventually found that the mouse is actually a M601-3 Centrophorus Mouse and downloading the software for that will allow you to customize the keys, record macros, etc. I haven't done much with that, I did try to map the side buttons to skip songs and it didn't work. If you find the keyboard, the software doesn't recognize the keyboard at all. The closes I could find was the K503 RGB LED keyboard.The other issue is when power is shut off, the lights revert to the ""demo mode"" and the mouse sensitivity reverts to the slowest speed, so that whenever you restart your computer you have to reset these.

Probably because the mouse isn't small at all, anything larger would be too large. People with large hands will like it though.Secondly, it lacks accuracy for a gaming mouse. Adjusting dpi both with and without software (the software is quite good but unfortunately it should be on all the time like MSI Afterburner) gave me headache, it is always either too fast, too slow or both at the same time!Probably, i had too high expectations from a low budget product because my previous mouse was just perfect which i got a long time ago for like 10$.So, 5 stars for the keyboard + 3.5 stars for the mouse = 4 stars for the combo.","Great keyboard, decent mouse.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 18, 2018",True,4.0

I bought this Sept 29, 2021 so i got less than 3 months of usage before it completely died.It's a good value keyboard and mouse combo but after 2 months of use, the membrane under the ""Enter key"" became overly sensitive and it keeps pressing the enter key without even being touched.  To clarify, whenever I hit keys near the enter key, the slight bend in the keyboard engages the enter key.  I am not even putting pressure on the keys and It does this even when I am so delicately pressing the keys. This is major flaw and I have hard time unlocking my pc because whenever I am entering the passcode the enter key interrupts and presses itself in the middle of the passcode.  At first, I thought I was hacked but after switching out the keyboard the problem went away.  To further test this theory I pressed underneath the keyboard where the enter key is located and amazingly enter key was pressed.  Not from the top but from the bottom of the keyboard!  I now hit the enter key really hard to create some separation between the membrane and the plastic bottom and this seems to work for now.Also, I was so used to having PC sleep button on my previous Logitech keyboard and not having this function on this keyboard is bit of a inconvenience.  The mouse works perfectly and very precise.  It feels and weighs just right.  Lighting on the keyboard and mouse is fire. I really wanted to like this keyboard but this enter key issue I am having is a deal breaker and I would not recommend this product.  I am past the return period and stuck with this.

Only problem is some of the bigger keys like  shift and space are really inconsistent with how they feel to type with. The rgb is great for working at night. However, one issue with the rgb is the keyboard software wouldn't detect the keyboard in my case, so customization was limited. The mouse software did work though, and all mouse buttons are able to be remapped. Another cool feature is drain holes on the bottom of the keyboard in case something spills on it. The mouse also has a nice braided cable. Speaking of the mouse, the clicks and two extra buttons are really clicky and satisfying.

The keys for the keyboard are very gummy feeling and don't seem very pleasant to type on. Not only that, but some of the keys are extremely unresponsive.

Also, I was very excited to have the colors on the keys and utilize the cool effects, but all of the effects are really loud. Like, when I put it on ""breathing"" mode I hear a reasonably loud electrical whine when it is cycling from on to off, to the point where I only use a solid color because it's so jarring to my ears.As for the mouse, it is okay. The thumb buttons are really far forward for how I hold the mouse but I think they would work for other people. The texture on the mouse is very pleasant and I like the ability to add/remove weights. As for the responsiveness though, I bought a wired gaming mouse thinking it was going to be more responsive but it is not. It is pretty unresponsive and seems to drift a lot.

If I were rating just the mouse, I'd give it a 5.The keyboard is the weak part of this deal. It looks nice, and it functions as it should, but the key presses are just too squishy. Compared to my old Logitech, it's hard (when in a frantic game) to tell if the buttons are fully depressed. It's worked so far, it just feels off. The placement of the function key also bothers me, as the right Windows key is the one I actually use. It's a decent keyboard, but by itself it'd probably be a 3.

Doesn't feel like it chaffs like literal sandpaper, but I like rougher surfaces for my hands for grip. Mouse gliding, again, another thing pretty smooth. My specific issue is the product representation which is the rainbow effect on the keyboard. It's disappointingly faded on certain parts of the keyboard. The top, for instance (F keys), are lit up, but the color is hardly there. I know this may be more of an affordable breathing color KBM, but nevertheless I must be honest about one of the interesting themes of the Keyboard.

I have not used the 2nd set of WADS keys (Set on the lower right of the keyboard) as most games I play require the use of the 1-5 keys, F keys, and Q,E,R, SHIFT, and CTRL keys.The mouse also seems to be well built and is relatively comfortable, even for extended use.  The 8g weights inside add a little bit of weight to the mouse, which doesn't seem like much but I like the little bit heavier mouse.  The 2 thumb buttons are nice, although I like the one closer to the back of the mouse as it is located to all I have to do is quickly tap it with my thumb to use it.

The keyboard and mouse work perfectly for this purpose (which is why I evaluate this more like a gaming controller than as a full-on keyboard-and-mouse).It has some odd behaviors like, for example, when I reboot my system it often will not see the keyboard and mouse, and I have to re-plug them. I don't know if this is due to this kit, or to my hardware, though I've never had that problem before with other mice.Although this has RGB, it is ""primative""-- it may or may not fit your needs. It isn't programmable, and there isn't any PC-side software for it. It has several modes you toggle through with a key combination, and then a separate key combination lets you cycle through colors (when appropriate for the particular effect).

However, I had already ordered a Redragon Mammoth gaming mouse prior to this purchase, so my main concern was the quality of the keyboard. I was not disappointed. Although the keyboard is a membrane keyboard, the keys feel somewhat like those of a mechanical keyboard, making this keyboard a good choice for those on a budget. The activation force is around 55 grams, and the matte finish of the keyboard feels fantastic. My favorite feature of this keyboard is the texturing of the F and J keys, which makes it extremely easy to find the home row, even if this keyboard does not have backlit keys.
