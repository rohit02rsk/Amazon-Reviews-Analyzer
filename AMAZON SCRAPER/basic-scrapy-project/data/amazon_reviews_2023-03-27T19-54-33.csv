B00NLZUM36,"Product is awesome. Works fantastically. No issues at all, and functions as it's supposed to. My only complaint is how it was shipped. It was sent via USPS and not through Amazon itself, which caused a lot of problems. First, the package was way too big to fit inside a mailbox (obviously) but it also could not fit inside a parcel mailbox either, and I was forced to retrieve it from the post office. Items like this are better sent via Amazon's own delivery service, or Fedex, etc. USPS is not designed to deliver large packages. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.",Great keyboard.

B00NLZUM36,the keyboard is actually decent but the mouse sensor is pretty dog water even for regular use.. i dont know if its cuz i dont have a mousepad but the mouse isn't great.edit: ok it turns out you need to put in the weights and get a book of a certain texture or a mousepad to make the sensor perform better.,its alright.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 28, 2023",True,4.0

B00NLZUM36,Updated after enough use to adequately review 12/10/22:The keys are a tad bit too small. The mouse after one day - right mouse button sticks. I use it to toggle zoom so I don't press and hold it I just tap it. The left button does have a satisfying click and the resolution of the mouse improved gaming performance by an order of magnitude.Interesting but true - see picture - this keyboard has two R keys. The left R key is actually the E key.I can touch type on the keyboard but it takes some getting used to because of the small size of the keys and the smaller than usual spacing. I will live with it for a while but I should have bought a mechanical keyboard.This will definitely improve your gaming performance if you are currently using any form of wireless mouse. I was using Logitech M510 wireless gaming mouse and a Logitech ergonomic keyboard and they both experienced latency and connection issues.Overall very satisfied.,Great Upgrade at Great Price,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 9, 2022",True,4.0

B00NLZUM36,"Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the ""you get what you pay for"" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange ""tall"" type that relocates the ""\"" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. ""#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?"" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... ""What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return"". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.","You cannot get a better keyboard and mouse combo in this price range, I am certain of it.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 20, 2016",True,5.0

B00NLZUM36,"This was a very good deal. I got it expecting it to last around 6 months before breaking. I was extremely surprised. So far it is the same as on day one. The keys are a little loud, but I don't mind that. The keys have a good feal to them. Also, the lights are very good quality and are easily customized. Just a simple FN and Insert, Home, Page up, Delete, End < or page down button and you have change in lights. You don't have to download some sketchy website to change the colors. The mouse is good and works well. Gives off and receives light well. It is a really great deal that will last you a long time. It works for both gaming, work, and school use. Very smooth. Also, it is easy to change mouse speed. Just one click of a button and you are done.

B00NLZUM36,"This is a great keyboard. My Logitech stopped working after a few years, and I needed a replacement.  I figured I would get the same one but when I looked it up it was 120 dollars that I didn't have.  I saw this one had great reviews and for under 40 dollars I decided to give it a shot.  I spent a lot of time using the computer, and I game a LOT.  It's not clicky, but I can still feel the press of each key when I'm using it.  I love the low profile buttons.  The lighting is beautiful, I rotate through a few of the different colors and lighting effects.  My favorites are the pastel rainbow, and the mode that slowly fades through each color on a rotation. My one and only complaint would be that the finish on the keys is wearing off.  I've only had this for two months now, and as you can see by my picture, the paint on the WASD and space bar is wearing off in places.  The corners of the 2 and 3 buttons are also wearing off as my nail hits against it when I'm hitting my W key.  But again, I game a LOT, as I said.  I am very hard on this thing, so a bit of wear is kind of expected.  If they sell replacement keys I would absolutely buy them because I really enjoy this keyboard. Maybe a gamer pack of keys - WASD and space bar only?",Great budget gaming keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 7, 2022",True,4.0
