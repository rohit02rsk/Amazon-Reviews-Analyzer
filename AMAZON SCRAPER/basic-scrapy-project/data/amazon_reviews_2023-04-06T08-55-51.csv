B09TZWLFLY,"First, I bought this for my wife. She uses this for Minecraft, and a few other similar type games, so not a hardcore gamer, but she does like it. She doesn't care for the LED's (although maybe some people only buy it for that) but there is a button to turn them off. However they always turn back on.With all that said, it was a solid buy. Feels solid, and seems well made. My wife's only complaint (aside from the LEDs that don't stay off) is that key travel is a bit long. Would probably buy again.",Like this keyboard with very few flaws,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on April 1, 2023",True,4.0
B09TZWLFLY,"Just got the keyboard. Really like it so far. The feel when you press a key is nice. Not to too spongy. You know when it bottoms out but it does it elegantly.Super quiet. Yes, it is a membrane keyboard, but it is quieter than my other membrane keyboards.Very sturdy metal frame. No flexing when I pound on the keys.Anti-ghosting EXCEPT for the X key. Weird.  If you hold down both shift keys and press X, nothing happens. A minor annoyance.So far, so good!","Great feel, quiet, no flex","Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 29, 2023",True,5.0
B09TZWLFLY,"Got this when my last keyboard finally gave up the ghost. I use it for coding, not for gaming, but figured if it was good enough to stand up to gaming then it could handle the daily abuse a coder would put it through. I am very pleased! Keys are very quiet, and have a great feel to them. Also, since the keys are raised above the keyboard bed instead of encased inside it, clean up with a can of air is a breeze. So far, my only criticisms would be: Seems to be an inch to and inch and a half shorter than my old keyboard, so I'm having to re-learn the keys at times (i keep hitting ""C"" looking for ""V"", etc). I'm sure this is just a ""me"" thing and will improve over time. Also, the keyboard has a weird habit of turning its backlight back on after I shut down my computer. This is more of an annoyance really.",Overall a very good keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 23, 2023",True,4.0
B09TZWLFLY,"I tried a wireless and after having two keyboards that locked up while typing, I purchased this corded one. The color cannot be changed other that off and brightness but, I knew that before I purchased. Love the action of the keys. Just been using a week now and hope it will be working for years to come. So far A+",As advertised works great,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on April 4, 2023",True,5.0
B09TZWLFLY,"After about 1 week of use:The Good:*This keyboard is quite. The keys strokes are mostly soft and feel light, with most keys having no real click to them.*The Frame is an formed aluminum plate thick enough to give this keyboard a real solid feel.*The keys are positioned over what appears to be a single silicone barrier, meaning I would expect this keyboard to stand up to most simple spill over the stop of the key board.The Bad:*While this keyboard does have LEDs that are a few colors, they are not RGB addressable LEDs. (which is what I had actually searched for [*shaking fist at amazon's search engine*]) So you will have no control over which colors the keyboard displays, but only if they are on or off. Now, in all fairness, this is not a strike against the keyboard as it is exactly as advertised, and I should have read the description more carefully, but is still more than a little disappointing.The Ugly:*Nope. So far I have nothing to report as ""Ugly"".Bottom line: Provided the user wants a keyboard that is back lit with a fixed set of colors, I would recommend this key board to anyone.",Solid keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 2, 2023",True,4.0
B09TZWLFLY,"Replacing a terrible keyboard starts off at a low bar, but I wanted a keyboard that wasn't too far from my Macbook's. This one is solid metal that hugs the desk surface. The keys are light but feel precise and quiet. The keyboard is sturdy and quality enough to give me confidence and I'm proud of it. So glad I didn't overspend.",solid,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 22, 2023",True,5.0
B09TZWLFLY,"I am currently writing this review with my new keyboard!!! This keyboard is all you need!! Its smooth and the RGB lights straight up pop! Its base is made of a metal and it has weight to it. Its large so you know what your getting. The buttons are perfect for gaming. The keys are raised like on all boards BUT with a low raise line so your fingers never get caught going up. It just smooth for the figure. You wont get sensitive figure tips from all the sliding. The edges on the keys are slightly rounded. Its worth the price all day long!! If you game, then you will thank me later!!",WHAT!!! AMAZING!!!,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 22, 2023",True,5.0
B09TZWLFLY,I needed a replacement that I could see and use. I do not game so I cannot tell you if it is a good gaming keyboard. For regular use it is great.,Great every day keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 30, 2023",True,5.0
B09TZWLFLY,"Not like my old Gigabyte mechanical keyboard, but a fraction of its price!At the price point I'd say its great for what it is.The keys press too slow though...not ideal for a gamer by anymeans.But its a keyboard and doesnt cost 200 dollars!",Its a keyboard!,"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 18, 2023",True,4.0
