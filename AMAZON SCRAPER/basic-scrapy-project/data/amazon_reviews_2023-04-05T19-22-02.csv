B0BCNLGVMH,"I was worried about buying an office chair online.  This chair definitely exceeded my expectations!  It was easy to assemble.  I love having armrests that can flip out of the way if needed.  The chair lifts or lowers to the desired height and can rock back and forth.  The cushioning, although it felt stiff at first, is just right for good support and comfort.  I have an injured tailbone and find it amazingly comfortable without using my cushion pad.  The chair fits my petite size (5'3"").  The gray and white color blends well into my home decor.  I will purchase again for my other office!",GREAT CHAIR!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2023",True,5.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"This is the first review I’ve ever wrote, honest. This is a very good chair for the price.  The elevating spindle on my second hand luxury chair was going bad, so I began looking around the net.  Other reviews indicated this was an excellent chair for a low price. With many favorable ratings to its credit I decided to purchase it.  I can report that it is very satisfactory.  It is light enough to move around with ease, even from room to room. Viewing the wheel casters online, I was worried about their strength, as they look a little flimsy in pictures.  However, the casters turned out to be very substantial.  After viewing the online video showing its assembly, it was no problem to put the chair together.  I like it, for the usable value and low price.  Yes, I would recommend it to others.",Well Pleased,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2023",True,5.0

B0BCNLGVMH,"Working from home half time and trying to find the best ergonomic set up for small space.  I’m 5’3” and found the adjustable chair height good, but I believe my desk is too tall for proper ergonomics and I have to use a cushion to sit higher.  I probably need to look for a new desk!! The back support is good if you sit all the way back but I tend to sit closer to front edge of chair to reach the keyboard as I am doing virtual meetings all day and typing on keyboard during most of my meetings. The support length under thigh is good although I wish the front end could be tilted up a little as it feels like it is sloping down a little and it might be due to not enough cushioning in front.  The arm support is at good height for ergonomics but I tend not to use the arm rests as the height of my desk and level of arm rests don’t allow me to scoot chair in close enough due to my desk style.  I do love being able to fold the arms up for storage when I’m not using it to make more space. I’m not sure if the chair is supposed to rock back or lean back but it took a lot of effort for me to make it lean back.  My 6’ tall husband sat in chair and says it was comfortable and he was able to rock the chair back and forth with no effort.Price was decent- I purchased during Black Friday sale.Easy to assemble, all parts included, no additional tools needed.

Very good bottom half design.* This chair is comfortable so far and it should get better as I sit it farther.* Fairly priced.Now the Con's*In the upright neutral position, for me, I am sitting TO straight up. This chair needs to lean back more in the neutral position. To help this, I use a foot rest that help lean back naturally.* The arm rest bolts to the back side of the back rest. The way this is designed, at this point, the chair will fail/break. The more you lean back, the faster it will fail. These arm rest pieces are made of molded nylon like material, which should be made from stamped steel.Before I retired, I designed aircraft parts for many years. Simply, when designing parts, if all possible, you design parts to enter-lock with each other, THEN use fasteners to hold them together.This chair does not do this. This point is the weakest link.

B0BCNLGVMH,"My current office chair broke, and I bought this because it was on sale and I needed something asap. I knew that this chair was not a forever chair when I bought it but I have some pretty big concerns about the structural integrity of this chair.Ok, first the positive. It was easy to assemble, if not a bit cumbersome. If you’ve put together any furniture before then it’s fine. It’s only screws, nothing else. The back feels nice and lumbar support is decent.The negatives. As you can see in the photos, the base, arguably the most important part as far as sturdiness goes, has questionable welding at best. On each of the 5 legs the welding only goes about half way around leaving big gaps. Second, the quality of the weld where the wheels attach just looks like it’ll bend with any resistance. We’ll see though. Additionally, the entire back piece is just plastics, no metal involved at all. When you attach the back to the seat, even when you only slightly tighten the acres the plastic starts crumbling away. I fear that with continued pressure the screws will wear through the plastic. The seat is almost definitely made of particle board and over tightening the screws will likely crack it. The cushioning leaves much to be desired. Next, the arm rests are way too low, if you are tall they are basically useless. At least you can raise them, but seeing as how they are a part of the back, you cannot remove them. Finally, once it is all been assembled, the chair does not seem sturdy and has a bit of a side to side wobble. I am below the posted weight limit of 300 lbs, so there is no reason this chair should give out on me but, I’m concerned.Overall, if you are looking for a chair and you can spend a little more, then you absolutely should do that. I would not recommend this chair at all.I’ll update this as I use it, as I highly suspect something will give out sooner rather than later.",Not the sturdiest,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023",True,2.0

B0BCNLGVMH,"Chair was easy to assembly.  I found that when sitting on the seat (with the chair at the highest position) and after adjusting the tilt mechanism so the seat tilts back, the seat tended to tilt down at the front - causing me to want to slide out of the seat.  BTW - my body weight is well below the chair rating.  Therefore, my weight is not an issue.The cushion is about 2"" thick.  So, if you are planning to sit in the chair for more than an hour, plan to put a pillow of cushion on the seat.  I think if the manufacturer spent another $10 on a better cushion, it would have been a good investment on their part.I contacted customer service about the seat tilting forward issue and they wanted a video showing this.  I did a return on the chair.  BEWARE...keep the box as you will need to disassemble the chair and put it back the box to ship it UPS.  You can't just go drop off the assembled chair at Kohls.  Also, be prepared to use a mallet to get the cylinder out of the chair bracket as there is a tight press fit.

B0BCNLGVMH,"I will state up front that I am very finicky when it comes to office chairs. Overall, this is a fairly nice product. I’ve assembled a lot of chairs over the years, and the assembly for this one is pretty typical, although there may have been a couple more fasteners than most I’ve done. The only issue I had during assembly was with the four white plastic screw covers that go over the screw holes on the back. The bottom two snapped in fine, but I had to take a razor blade and shave off some of the length of the inserted part of the plastic covers for the two that went in the top holes. In the end, it worked out fine.The bottom cushion is very comfortable and it looks like it will stand up to a lot of daily use. I do wish the seat height would adjust up about another inch beyond where it will go, but it is not a problem. I love that the arms will fold up out of the way. It is rare that I would ever use arms.The chair will rock a little bit front to back, and that actually makes it more comfortable.

B0BCNLGVMH,"Was in need of a new office chair after the old one at my PC desk broke. This fit the bill well. It arrived very well packed and as described.The chair was very easy to assemble. The instructions had a few typos and grammatical errors, but the pictures were detailed enough to make it easy to put together. It took me about 15 minutes to assemble the chair by myself.The chair feels very stable and is well made. As a bigger guy, I have a hard time finding office chairs where I am not at or over the recommended maximum weight. But at 6' 2"" and 260lbs, I feel comfortable and secure sitting in this chair.While the chair is pretty comfortable, I do have two negatives for the chair. First, the angle of the seat seems to lean forward a bit much for my preference. You can adjust the forward tilt of the chair, but even at its maximum backwards lean, the seat doesn't quite lean back far enough for my preference. The second complaint is that after a long time sitting in the chair it can get a little uncomfortable; but this can be true of sitting anywhere for extended periods. The seat cushion is very dense, and it can be little uncomfortable to sit on for long uninterrupted periods of time. Taking some time to stand up and stretch will help to relieve that.Overall, the chair is a good chair, I use it every day and it feels solid.",Nice Solid Office Chair,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 26, 2022",False,4.0

The front does tilt downward, to reduce the stress on your legs, but if you're shorter like me (5'4"") and need the chair a little higher for the desk, you feel like you're going to slip off. My husband, who uses it way more often, says its comfortable. The tilt is very stiff though and difficult to hold, exerts a lot of muscle. We tried adjusting the tension under the seat but I didn't notice a difference.  Hoping it just needs a break in period.

B0BCNLGVMH,"It is almost a shame to keep this beauty hidden at home. The black with white accents is incredible in person, the chair is comfortable, and best of all - it can store under your desk without you having to lower it or make it higher, or put it in sideways as I had the unfortunate experience of doing in college.The chair is super easy to assemble - 10-15 minutes at the most. You also get some extra parts which is daunting until you realize that they are actually meant to come with the chair and clearly listed.It is not the ""shiatsu massage while you're working"" type of chair, and that is clearly reflected in the price. It is very comfortable and supports your lumbar well, but this is not something you can adjust (that comes in when you multiply the price of this chair by 2 or 3).And the design is just fantastic. I am used to leather chairs of black or mahogany color, but this is a very nice welcome for me into the 21st century (I have seen, sat, and worked in these types of chairs before, never one this good looking, and this is the first time that I own this type of design).It is hard to pick what is best about this chair, but I have to say, the way that the arms are put in the upright position is something you will come to love. It is simple, yet eloquent, and just remembering how many times I have snubbed a toe on the wheels of my previous home office chair give me nightmares.

     Immediately upon unboxing and unpacking all of the various pieces and parts I was pleasantly overwhelmed by the thoroughness of the packaging, you can really tell whether someone cares about their product by how it's dressed up before it's sent off. These guys went above & beyond to keep everything well organized and also protected before shipping. Which was immediate good vibes.The overwhelming bit was how many individually wrapped packages there were, i was thinking maybe it'd be difficult to assemble because of that, NOPE. Clear concise directions, just 6 steps ( with some partial steps on some ) they provided everything needed to assemble, which i usually ignore as I have plenty of tools. But the allen key included was of a sturdier sort than is typical. So assembly went smoothly. They also included extra pieces and parts!!! Always appreciated.Took about 25 mins once all the packaging was removed from the various pieces. But it could have been done much sooner, I took my time a bit along the way to try to assemble it as perfectly as possible and of course admire my handiwork ha. Did it solo, no help needed.I ordered this ergonomic office chair to attempt to replace/compare it with the older chair I have. As I've been spending a fair amount of time in front of the computer lately. I got the old one from a big box office retailer, at a price point similar to this chair. There is absolutely no question as to which I prefer. This new chair is excellent, it really shattered my expectations.It moves extremely fluidly across the floor, about the same weight as my previous chair but it is much easier to move due to the wheels and the new chair's overall design being vastly superior. High quality materials went into every aspect of this chair. It does a really good job of having a durable feel, like it's going to last for quite some time but not looking bulky in the slightest.What was surprising to me is the ability to lean back a bit in it, to comfortably rest, fully seated with some solid lower lumbar support and the chair doesn't unintentionally slide back & then you have to readjust and roll yourself forward. You can rock in place, slightly, if you wish, without being inconvenienced. I'd thought for sure with how smoothly it can roll I'd need a mat for it or a rug but it works excellently on just a laminate floor.I apologize for taking up so much of your time and thank you if you've made it this far into my long winded review, I just really like this chair. 10/10","This chair may yet save my posture, wonderful for extended periods of gaming or desk work.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2022",False,5.0

I had a bit of trouble putting in the bottom armrest screw. This was mostly due to (1) trying to do this on a couch instead of on a more stable table or workbench, (2) my eyesight isn’t as good as it used to be, and (3) my 68-year-old fingers are not as nimble as they used to be. Eventually, I had to remove the upper armrest screw (which I had inserted first). Then I could see well enough to get the bottom screw started, and then redo the upper screw.

I found the video instructions on the product listing to be infinitely useful, and it is how I assembled the chair.Style:The chair has a very good style and appearance. It looks like something you would find in a very modern office setting.Functionality:I use a 59” computer monitor and use a kitchen table for a desk. This product allows me to fold up the arms so I can really scoot into the table. This is one of my favorite features.The chair has about 5 inches of vertical movement that is set with a lever on the right-hand side. This is sufficient for me. This lever can also lock the seat in place so it doesn’t lean back.The chair also has a knob on the bottom front to adjust how easy it is to lean back. This chair has a tendency to keep you upright and it is a good position to be productive, but it’s really not the position I like to be when I am browsing or doing unproductive stuff.Even on the loosest setting, the chair doesn’t lean back very easily. For the leaner, you usually scoot your bottom near the front of the seat to get a good lean in, but because of the design of this chair, it wants to push you upright again. That’s just physics. If you want to really get a good lean, you need to prop your legs up on a table or something else.Comfort:This chair has good lumbar support and it is probably one of the best I’ve seen in office chairs.The overall comfort of the chair isn’t very high. The padding on the seat and arms is pretty thin. If you’re the type that likes to lean on one arm of a chair, your elbow is going to get sore.The worst aspect of this chair is the thinness of the seat cushion. It feels comfortable at first, but after spending some time in the chair, your tailbone feels tired and sore. This is directly related to the amount of cushion on the seat. I ordered an additional seat cushion to see if this improves it.Construction:The construction of this chair is very good and strong. While looking at the product photos online, I was a little nervous that this would be a little on the chincy side. That is not the case and everything is sufficiently solid enough to handle the job. I predict that this chair will last a long time or regular use.Overall, because I like a lot more comfort in my office chairs, I will most likely be replacing this chair soon. If you are more of a sit upright and proper person, this might be the chair for you. Because of this I do not recommend this product.",Not Built for the “Lounger”,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 12, 2022",False,3.0
B0BCNLGVMH,The chair came well packaged.  It was a bit difficult to put together with just one person. I’ve assembled office chairs at work so I was a little familiar with how it should be done but it still would have helped with someone holding the pieces in places while the second person screws them in.It is very nice material and it is sharp looking. However I don’t get much adjustment on the lumbar support but the height does go up and down easily.  You also cannot adjust the arm height or push them out; they are fixed.Office chairs have become very expensive.  I guess for this price this chair is sufficient.  I recommend if you’re strapped for cash otherwise splurge for a truly adjustable ergonomic office chair.,Sufficient for my needs,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 20, 2022",False,3.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"I would give this a good rating, not great and not terrible.  This is a middle of the road chair.  Super easy to put together.  The seat padding could be a little thicker which would have helped beef up the rating.  Don't get me wrong, it is not uncomfortable, but I have had more comfortable chairs.  Its good, not great.",good chair,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 2, 2022",False,3.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"this is pleasing to the eye but that's about it,it took me a while longer to build than other chairs because the base has to be build from scratch, the good thing is that it's meatal so that's a plus.the seat has a big soft cushion which makes it comfortable, the arm rest folds out of the way is you need it and are padded but not much.what I didn't like about it is that it doesn't come with a head rest and there's practically no tilt on the chair even at it's softest setting, when you lean on it, it just springs you back in to place.honestly not worth the money",could be better,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 24, 2022",False,3.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"I like that the arm rests go up to slide the chair under the desk, and the lumbar support, but that’s about all unfortunately. When I sat in it, I immediately felt like I was being dumped out of the chair. It leans forward and there is no way for me to adjust it so that it doesn’t sit at a forward angle. It is also very hard to lean back in it. I can not stay leaning back at all while using to computer even at its loosest setting. For me the chair is useless.",Am I being dumped?!?,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 3, 2022",False,2.0
B0BCNLGVMH,"I got the chair in.  I un-packaged it today and started putting it together.  I noticed how cheap the base was and would not hold up very long at all.  I hate that too, because I was going to use my old base which was heavy duty.  I tore my old chair apart where it made it unusable now, which sucks since I am stuck with this junk until I go to Office Depot to buy a new one.  This one sits low to the floor.  It would not be bad for a 10 year old that is short, but I am 6ft 3in tall and 270lbs.  It says it tilts back, but nooooo I am still sitting forward almost like it is dumping me out of it.  The arm rests are too low, so it makes them pretty much unusable.  I can not say anything good about this chair.Be fair warned, do not waste your money on this product!",Not worth $1.00 in my opinion,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 10, 2022",False,1.0

B0BCNLGVMH,I was surprised at how much value this office chair packs. The seat padding almost instantaneously takes stress off of me and the lumbar support was pretty amazing.

B0BCNLGVMH,"I am officially in love with my new chair! It was easy to put together by myself in about 1 hour and 15 minutes from the time I opened the box to its completion, which included verifying all parts and reading the instructions before proceeding with assembly. Everything about it works as advertised and exceeds my expectations for this product. For reference, I am a 5’2” woman and this chair fits my body perfectly. I can actually sit all the way back in the chair with my feet flat on the floor and my arms resting comfortably on the armrests. I have no need for extra cushioning or pillows to prop me up or forward, which is very rare for me with most furniture. The fabric, padding, plastic, and other materials used in the chair are all comfortable to touch. The lumbar support is a nice feature, too. I bought this chair for multipurpose use as my sewing/art/craft/office/everything chair. It will function well for all of my purposes.
