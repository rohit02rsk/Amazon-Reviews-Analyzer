B07QQFP6J5,"I ordered a half size too big because I'd rather have them loose then tight. Thr strap on top that goes between the toes is really tight and I have slender feet. I really had to work my feet in. My hope is that it loosens over time as the flip flops are broken in. The cushion is thinner then I thought it would be. Though it is comfortable right now, I don't expect it'll stay that way for long. But that doesn't mean it's a bad shoe. It'll just be worn down to be flat and hard like any other shoe instead of staying cushiony. The bottom of the shoe is also thin and made of a light foam. I thought it was going to be a heavier duty rubber. It's not a bad shoe but its not blowing me away either. For not much more I can go get a nice pair at the department store of much better quality.
