B08FT3ZMF3,"I have literally bought 5+ pair of Sennheiser MX-680 over the years, because they sound great, and work for my purposes with same situation Sansa Clip+ MP3 players (way more than 5+) for about 12 years. Both of those devices are rare now, and I am facing the fact that it's time to get into the modern era. I download about 25 podcasts on Sunday to listen to while I toil at my job all week. I have tested and returned several devices in the last month or so, but I have held on to these earbeans. If you have seen or own a set, you know why I refer to them as earbeans. They sound and/or fit better than 3 other wireless sets that I have tried. More consistent bluetooth connections with several devices, and may even sound better than the wired Sennheisers on my gaming laptop... They tend to work their way out of my ears gradually requiring me to push them back in a little after a couple hours, but it beats the alternative of having my ears clogged with silicone ear tips which I don't care for. Weirdest thing I have to complain about is that when I go outdoors, the bluetooth connection gets real flukey. I don't understand it, but when I am indoors or in a car, it's perfect. When I step outside, it's in and out (same with Raycons which I tested at the same time)... Finally, when paired with my Galaxy S8 (yes I am old and don't buy a new phone every year or less), I can't seem to get them loud enough, but I think that's the nanny nature of the phone not wanting to damage one's hearing and not so much the earbeans because they will go much louder on the PC... Take it from someone who will reject anything of questionable quality, these are good. Raycon on the other hand (at $55 more) - going back.",Noob with BlueTooth Earbuds somewhat impressed with these EARBEANS!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2023",True,4.0
B08FT3ZMF3,"When I first got this earbuds I was not too sure how comfortable it would fit my ears. First day of wearing it for more than 5 hours, it hurt near my ear canals. But after wearing it constantly everyday, it feels normal. I personally wouldnt buy it for noise cancellation ability. The bass is really good. But the most important point of this earbuds is its battery life. Almost 8 hours of it is insane for a person that constantly uses it (without noise cancellation). Overall I would recommend it",Is not your regular type of earbuds,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2023",True,5.0
B08FT3ZMF3,"These earbuds are different from most that they don't require a rubber plug to sit directly in the ear canal. IF the shape of your ears is compatible, they sit in a bend of the outer ear. The online manual shows and illustration whereby the buds are held ""correctly"" in a more or less vertical position, and ""incorrectly"" in a more horizontal position. There's no way that the earbuds will provide good sound in my ears in the ""correct"" position, but luckily the ""incorrect"" position is fine. I would not expect the full fidelity of a pair of expensive in-ear earbuds, but they are certainly sufficient for casual listening to music, and have sufficient bass and treble response. I especially like that they can be charged in their battery-containing case, and that the case itself can be charged wirelessly with or without the earbuds inside. As far as noise cancellation is concerned, that is not what I purchased these earbuds for, and I would imagine it would not be anywhere nearest effective as something that creates an actual physical seal. I find that I can walk around with them without having to worry about them falling out, but as far as intense physical activity, probably not. Again, it all depends on how well these fit in your ears.","Small, not really ""in ear""","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2023",True,4.0
B08FT3ZMF3,"I would compare the Buds Live to the Sony Linkbuds as far as an open ear bud.  The Sony has some decent mids and highs, and are a bit more open.  These only imply bass.  The Samsung buds have way more bass response, highs are there, but a little more quiet.  The Buds live feel a touch less open.  A tweek ro the equalizer made a big difference, however.Between the two, I'm picking the Samsung Buds Live.

B08FT3ZMF3,"Enjoy taking these with me everywhere, as the case easily fits in any pocket. The earbuds sit well in my ear, and provide great volume; turning earbud volume on high and phone volume on high hurts, usually have both about half. A little on the touch sensitive side, as earbuds often pause or skip music, even if that's not what I intended. These earbuds have a noise canceling function, but that's not the primary design (suggest getting something else, if that's your primary reason). Battery life is excellent for their size; used continually for almost 5 hours (noise canceling function off). Case will completely recharge earbuds twice, without being plugged in. The only complaint is that I have to constantly adjust the earbuds if I'm doing rigorous exercise or work; they've fallen out during runs.

Then I remembered this one that went down a completely different design pathway.

B08FT3ZMF3,"Very pleased with these! The SQ is more than adequate. Listen to a wide range of music, from electronic, bass heavy tracks to soft jazz, these allow me to seamlessly engage with the music. Due to their open back design they give you a sense of airyness - the music seems to be around you rather than in your ears. This makes them phenomenal for watching movies. If you are after pure SQ the Sennheiser CX400BT have a more natural, balanced sound (nothing I've tried beats the Sennheisers in SQ), but the Galaxy Buds are more engaging and fun. There is no denying there is a professionally built sound in these! They also play louder and fit firmer, hence better for workouts. Are very comfy for long listening sessions (no pressure in your ears because they don't create a vacuumed seal) and are slim so you can lay on a pillow without them pushing into your ear. They also come packed with a bunch of features - you can adjust the controls, can find them through the app and can adjust the EQ through well designed presets. Can't say how much exactly they leak sound, but I wouldn't worry about it too much given the benefits and uniqueness of open-back design. The fact they don't block out the environment is a welcome feature for me because I don't have to take them out of my ears to have a conversation. I also don't mind hearing what is going on around me. Not for everyone, but definitely an excellent design some will appreciate.

B08FT3ZMF3,"Love these earbuds!  They're exactly what Samsung represents.  I like the open design.  It's nice to have ambient awareness without expending battery power to produce it, which is what happens with in-ear earbuds.The people dissing the ANC are missing the point.  The objective of these buds is to knock out low frequency background noise, not provide total isolation.  And they do an awesome job of that without eliminating the things you want to hear - like a flight announcement.To me, the sound quality is great.  The openness creates the impression of a much larger space.Battery life is a little disappointing.  With all features turned off, I expected close to eight hours use.  I pretty much killed a charge in about 5 hrs.  3.5hrs of that was a Zoom call, but the literature doesn't lead you to expect shorter life from calls.  Fortunately, you can use the buds individually, so can alternate if you can stand using one at a time.Also,I had the app active on my phone.  I think the battery life would be a little better with the app turned off.  Going to try that next.I've tried a bunch of earbuds.  These are by far the closest I've seen to perfect for my needs.

It sounds even better if you stuff them more into the ear (which defeats the open air design and will hurt in a short while).  I feel it will fall out at any moment if I follow the recommended placement.  I really wanted to keep them, but that fi, the shorter bluetooth range than my Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, and having fewer functions  -- such as tapping on the ears to turn up/down volume (has no accelerometer as the Buds Plus do), ambient pass through mode, and shorter battery life, made me stick with the Galaxy Buds Plus and return these.",Has Great Balanced Sound... but too difficult to position and stay in ears,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2021",True,4.0

B08FT3ZMF3,"These buds are hands down the most comfortable earbuds I think I've ever worn in my life. They take a little getting used to at first, because they go in a bit weird. But once I got used to them I practically forgot I was wearing them, aside from the music anyway. I've worn them during vigorous exercise and never felt like they were going to fall out (make sure you're using the right size wingtip for your ear). The only con that I can see for most people is that the active noise cancelling is not on par with headphones. If you buy these thinking you're getting ANC like your over the ear headphones, you're gunna be disappointed. However, they block out most of not all of the ambient sounds around you, while still leaving you enough hearing to be able to listen for say traffic or someone calling your name (if you have music playing and it's any kind of loud, you're not going to hear anyone or most anything within reason).

These do have noise cancellation and they can dull surrounding sounds. They work decent, but I would argue they're really not designed as a noise cancelling device it's just an added bonus. I would expect a true noise canceling pair to have an in ear canal seal or over the ear seal. These sit nicely outside the ear canal and provide great sound for music and phone calls. Additionally you can use them with multiple blue tooth devices. I've used them on microsoft teams calls and they work flawlessly. The software (at least on the Samsung phone) is some of the best I've seen. Lots of controls and options and if you have a power share device you can use the phone to recharge the case. The case is great not too big and has small magnetic tips that help with the placement of the buds in the charging port.

B08FT3ZMF3,"I was looking for a wireless earbud that didn't go into the ear canal, like the Apple airpods.  I read in reviews that these are good for people who have smaller ears and I purchased these for a teenage girl.  They did not fit.  These buds, however, are hot garbage especially compared to the airpods (I'm normally not a fan of apple products) in so many ways.-- The Sound --They are very mid heavy.  The airpods are as well but overall the sound is much higher quality on the airpods.  It may have to do with the design.  Mine came with the bass boost EQ set by default.  The sound stage is ok for an earbud, probably because there's no seal.  However, there is missing ranges all over the place.  And there is no way, from the Samsung Wear app, to make a custom EQ.  You have to pick from the pre-set EQ options and none of them are very good.  Neutral is missing massive amounts of high end and many of the other options are too bass heavy so I went with ""clear"" which is the least offensive.  Even on ""clear"" EQ setting, listening to an Audible book was giving me a headache because of the poor tuning on these buds.To give some perspective, I use Sony wf-1000xm3's as my primary bluetooth earbuds and 7hz Timeless as my primary wired set (The Timeless annihilate the Sony's but wireless have their place).  The Sony's are a little more expensive than these and sound waaaay better.  Heck, the regular Samsung Buds sound better than these and are more comfortable for more people.I think if you really don't care about the sound quality too much and they fit your ears really comfortably, then enjoy because some of the features are nice and battery is ok too.  If you're looking for better for less, look elsewhere.-- Comfort --If these fit your ears then they have the potential to be very comfortable.  However, of the 5 people I've had try these on, they only were comfortable for 1 person who had medium-small ears.  They did not fit the teenager at all and would fall out after a few seconds.  Nor did they fit my ears as the charging bump pushes them into an awkward angle to my ear and they start bothering me after a few minutes.

B08FT3ZMF3,"When I bought this product I thought it'll be a change from the silicone tip buds that I usually wear; those which go directly inside your ear and cause discomfort after a short amount of time. Upon trying the Samsung Galaxy buds Live, the bean structure did not sit comfortably in my ear. Because it doesn't have a silicone tip and doesn't go directly inside your earhole, it's very loose and will fall off if you run, jump, or do the slightest bit of cardio. Moreover, the beans themselves are a bit larger and slightly heavier than your usual buds - possibly a third bigger than your standard google pixel buds or air pods.  And unlike the silicone tip buds that we're often used to, the speakers for the Galaxy live are located on one side of the bean. So you really can't twist around too much to get that level of comfort and secureness. And because it doesn't go directly inside your ear, the speaker feels very distant, and the sound quality is not as immersive as a typical air pod or pixel bud. What's the point of noise cancellation if the product itself doesn't sit comfortably in your ear. I feel like if I tap the bean for calls, it'll fall off my ear anytime. Due to its odd shape, size, and location of the speakers, the galaxy buds live is not gym or workout friendly, and the sound quality lacks because of it. Personally I think standard silicone buds that go directly in your ear are not as uncomfortable as people say it is. And I would personally choose the galaxy buds pro or 2 over this one.

The music was also clear, no problems with the different genres I tested.After the first hours of use, they started hurting my ears, this was quite uncomfortable, but it ended up disappearing after a couple of days, thankfully.Now, here's what the deal breaker was for me... Noise cancellation. I'm used to the rubber tips and the way they block noises. These buds have nothing for a tip to be added. Due to the lack of this rubber tips, all kinds of noises can be heard, since the ear canal is not completely blocked. I HATED THIS. Tried them for a week, couldn't stand it.

B08FT3ZMF3,"My wife bought me Galaxy Buds Live in red for Christmas 2021. Not sure why I'm just getting around to a review now, but I have used them a lot and they still work great. Obviously, these will work best with a Samsung device and their app. Using mine with a Galaxy S21 Ultra.Let's address the odd shape first. This was really innovative of Samsung. It does give a different, more open sound than traditional earbuds or closed back over the ear headphones. It is somewhat comparable to on the ear headphones or open back over the ear. I wanted to try them to see if they caused less ear issues than typical earbuds or over the ear headphones. I have heard it theorized that the nickel in headphones is what causes ear irritation. There may be something to that. But for me, it's the heat and sweating inside my ear that causes issues. Irritation, weepy, crusty skin and occasionally full on ear infections. While the Galaxy Buds Live haven't completely eliminated this, they cause much less irritation and I can wear them much longer.The fit can be mildly annoying at times. I do have to fiddle with them from time to time and that usually results in accidental control taps. However, I have to make adjustments to typically shaped earbuds pretty frequently as well.The battery life is great. The buds last at least 4 hours using ANC. Longer without. The case is good for several days of charges.The ANC is impressive for earbuds at this price point, especially considering the odd shape.The sound quality is shockingly good. Ample bass. Clear mids and highs. Using the Samsung Wearable app provides plenty of settings to tweak to your liking.I would highly recommend the Galaxy Buds Live to anyone with a Samsung device or who wants to try something truly unique in a saturated earbud market.",Innovative Design That's Not For Everyone,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 25, 2023",False,4.0

B08FT3ZMF3,"I had issues with my Galaxy Buds Plus so Samsung gave me a refund and I decided to give these a try.  After a few days I decided they are going back.Pros:- Sound Quality- Looks (shape is unique and the colors look like liquid metal)- Battery lifeCons:- Active Noise Cancellation is a joke- Fit- Terrible terrible terrible touch controlsThese buds sound pretty darn good and the look of them is nice, but that can't overcome the cons of this product.Noise Cancellation: I won't spend a lot of time on this as most reviews I saw ahead of time pointed out how you can't get good noise cancellation without a seal so I wasn't expecting any real cancellation here, but I did want to address it since it is in the title of the product.  This wasn't a deciding factor for me, but I am sure it drove the price up for something that really doesn't do much.Fit: I hate the way these things fit.  I have followed Samsung's suggestions for how to put them in your ear, I have looked up Youtube videos, tried the different size wingtips that come with the buds, but no matter what I do I can't get these things to sit right.  They always feel like they are going to fall out and occasionally do.  I did find a way to get them to fit a little bit more securely (doing the opposite of what Samsung tells you) by pushing the speaker end deeper into my ear, but that interferes with the microphone, they still come loose and need to be adjusted and seems to be accentuating  the touch control issues.  Speaking of...Touch Control: This was the last straw for me in determining to return these.  I went for an hour walk and during that hour ran into so many issues with the touch controls.  To start/stop playback you tap the buds once, two times to skip a track and three times to go back a track.  I tried to skip a song several times on my walk and it only worked maybe 25% of the time.  Another 25% of the time it paused the song (thinking it was one tap) with the remaining 50% of the time it going back a song (thinking it was three taps).  This would then be compounded when I tried to skip the track it went back to so I could get to the one I wanted to skip in the first place, but instead it went back another track.  Then maybe I was able to get it to successfully skip ahead a song, but at this point I was 2 songs behind where I want it to be and the next attempt would put be back 3 again... or just pause the music altogether.Remember when I said these fit terribly?  Well if went to adjust them b/c they were coming lose, the touch controls more often than not think that I am trying to pause the music or skip a track (of course they skip a track when I don't want to).Summary: As I mentioned, I had the Buds Plus and while they were not perfect, they rarely ever came loose and the exact same touch actions worked much better (still not perfect).  Maybe I just have large ears and these will work better for others, but I hated them and likely will be purchasing another pair of Galaxy Buds Plus.",I hate these things,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 6, 2020",False,2.0

Great sound, bass bumps and way better than another pair I paid $150 for. The range is good, I can leave my phone in the other room and it's cool that you can use either pod independently. Battery life is surprisingly good, I can go multiple days and it supports wireless charging. The extra features on the app are a nice touch at this price. Noise cancelation isn't perfect but I use them in a loud gym and it blocks out pretty much everything if I have them in right. My only issue is touch sensitivity.

B08FT3ZMF3,"These are a huge step-up from the crap no-name buds I've wasted money on. I could have bought two sets of these with the money I wasted on generic cheapo ear turds. These are the Hyundai of the earphone world. They do not produce the kind of sound you'd get from their top-of-the-line model, and it would be ridiculous to expect them to. What you get is sound that's about as good as mid-range wired earbuds, in a package that is every bit as good as buds costing 4 times as much, PLUS real active noise cancellation that cuts the sound of things like a fan, but not your dog barking to go out. The included software is excellent. The best I've ever used. In short, if you get these for a price of around $50, you will be VERY pleased with your purchase.","Way, WAY better than cheapo no-name brands!","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022",False,4.0
B08FT3ZMF3,"i love these Galaxy Buds Live. So far these are the best buds i have pirchased to date. i do have an issue woth the connectivity sometimes while walking with my phone in my pocket. the sounds would sound like im losing conection to my phone but that is rare that it happens. Now for battery life, oh my gosh it would last almost my whole 10 hour shift on one charge. i would use one bud at a time so i could use it through my whole shift. The aound quality is awesome. o do love the fact that i dont have to push the bud all the way up in my ear just to stop the music. i just give it a tap (which can be difficult to find the right spot at times) and that is it. it looks great and i have never had them fall out while working. (i would be up down lofting containers and doing alot of walking around). i did use the noise cancellation one time at a motor cycle show. the noise in the auditorium was very loud so itried it out. these buds live drowned down the sound quite a bit, but im sure if i left it on for too long my battery would drain faster (as it should with any device).

They came with enough juice to connect and give a test run.Very clear when it came to speaking to someone on the phone, everyone on the other end said it was super clear.they stayed in place when I went grocery shopping, the color is beautiful blends with my red hair.. lolMy packaging for the buds was sealed, these were NOT used.

B08FT3ZMF3,"I was skeptical at 1st regarding others feedback stating that the buds didn't noise cancel. The fact is they do. Before activating that feature you put buds in ear space, listen to what's around you, then activate the feature. You will immediately hear the change in ambient/white noises around you.  Start you music or book and enjoy. Also, red is my favorite color and I love these buds. Oh, another thing. The old in ear buds material would make my ear itch as if there were bugs inside, im not getting that with these, I actual forget I'm wearing them.

B08FT3ZMF3,"J'adore utiliser ces écouteurs. La qualité du son est excellente, leur look est soigné, et l'étui se glisse aisément dans la poche. La durée de vie de la pile... Difficile à dire, je ne les ai jamais encore épuisées!Mes trois seules reserves sont par rapport au design. Premièrement, les contrôles tactiles sont un peu capricieuses. J'ai besoin de plusieurs essais parfois pour faire une pause ou avancer une chanson. Leur forme très arrondie fait en sorte qu'il est difficile de bien ""viser"" sa cible. Deuxièmement, ces écouteurs ont tendance à tomber si on bouge trop avec. J'aime bien faire le ménage en écoutant des podcasts et de la musique, mais comme il faut souvent se pencher, ces écouteurs ne tiennent pas toujours très bien. Plutôt vertigineux lorsqu'on lave la cuve de la toilette! Troisièmement, si vous êtes maladroits comme moi et avez le malheur d'échapper votre étui, huit fois sur dix, ils s'ouvrira et les écouteurs partiront glisser dans toutes les directions! Des aimants légèrement plus puissantes auraient pu éviter cela.Ceci dit, j'achèterai tout de même ces écouteurs en connaissant ces trois reserves d'avance, la raison principale étant qu'il est devenu très difficile de trouver une paire d'écouteurs de qualité qu'on ne doivent pas s'enfoncer dans le trou de l'oreille. Je n'ai jamais trouvé ce genre de système confortable pour moi, et malheureusement c'est celui qui domine le marché!

B08FT3ZMF3,"It's not often I'm surprised, but after being completely frustrated by a bunch of under-performing bone-induction headphones, I had been prepared to just find these acceptable. Instead, they're basically the solution I've been searching for all along.Fit: They stay in place no matter what I do, and aren't too hard to stick in. This is great because aside from in-ear headphones, I've never found a pair of BT earbuds that don't just drop out. And in-ears get uncomfortable.Controls: Pretty simple, and possibly the first inductive touch button enabled wearable I've had that actually works about as well as buttons. MostlySound: Are they audiophile quality? Well, no. But they sound better than most bluetooth headphones I've tried. They actually make music enjoyable to listen to.Active Noise cancellation: They have it. I'd say its about similar to fairly early generation high-end stuff. That is- it works quite decently, but has very obvious limits. So you sort of get the benefits of in-ear headphones, but can turn it off if you need better situational awareness.All in all, this is probably the first set of headphones (and Samsung product) I have zero qualms recommending to anyone.",These actually live up to the hype.,"Reviewed in Canada on September 9, 2022",True,5.0

B08FT3ZMF3,Can't believe that this is an official product by Samsung. The beans are not very comfortable but sit very tight to the ear. But the sound quality?

Get any other earphone and you are better off,Unbelievably bad - sound quality 1 star,"Reviewed in Canada on June 2, 2022",True,1.0
