B092DF433H,"Autofull was very responsive to my feedback on how to improve their product. One thing I really appreciated about this chair is that all the screws are in the right places and easy to access, making assembly a breeze. I would definitely buy from them again.The chair itself has excellent lumbar support, which is crucial for anyone who spends long hours sitting down. The memory foam cushion is also very comfortable and molds to your body. The chair has a chunky, sturdy feel to it, and the faux leather is soft and pliable, which hopefully means it won't crack like a harder, shinier faux leather would. Each part of the chair was carefully wrapped in foam to prevent any breakage or damage during shipping.One downside to the chair is that the armrests are quite hard and may crack or peel over time, so it's recommended to purchase soft covers for them. Additionally, the back support can be a bit annoying and pushes you further out from the chair, which then puts the leg support at the back of your knees. The cushion also tends to go flat after a few hours, which can make the chair uncomfortable for extended periods of sitting. However, despite these minor drawbacks, the chair is a great option for those looking for solid lumbar support and comfortable seating.","Comfortable and Sturdy, with Excellent Lumbar Support","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 18, 2023",True,5.0
B092DF433H,"Update: Okay, so the customer support is outstanding here! Changed back to 5-stars. Replaced the faulty part of my chair very quickly and were more than happy to help.I do like the overall design of the chair and the comfort isn't bad for the price. Lumbar support foam/pillow for the lower back is very nice. I do have a problem with the hydraulic giving out and my chair slowly descending to its lowest setting after sitting in it for a few minutes.  This problem just recently became a problem and it was only minor at first, but now it has stemmed into a pretty big annoyance. I am well below the weight threshold of the chair too so that's not what I believe to be causing this issue.I do like this chair because it is a big step up from my previous chair (arm rest broke and customer support was a ghost for my previous chair.) I am hoping the same doesn't stem from AutoFull and they will at least help out with the replacement base at a minimum since I haven't had the chair for a full year.  It will remain at 3 stars until this remedy is addressed.","Nice chair, but...","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 4, 2023",True,5.0
B092DF433H,"It's a really nice looking chair.  The instruction book is fancy to look at but it's difficult to try to read (itty bitty white & red font) - no regard for accessibility here.  Watch the videos instead. It had a strong plasticy smell for a couple of days, gave me a headache.  The armrests are terrible - the plastic is very slick, my arms slide around often.  I'll buy some armrest covers, but it's annoying that I have to spend more money on this chair, since it's not cheap to begin with.  It does fit me well, I'm 5'7"" and my last gaming chair was a little oversized for me. I hope it is good in the long term so I don't regret the price.",Mostly love it,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 13, 2023",True,4.0
B092DF433H,"Pros.Good chair but if your a bigger guy give it some time to wear the padding in!All steel construction is good back locks very firmly in place, promotes good posture.Very easy to put together takes about ten minutes, did not install leg rest so i cannot comment on that.Cons.Arm rests do not come up high enough for me but you can buy padded extenders for them, Tilt function is almost useless.Included back support pillow is nice but i constantly have to adjust it when i get in or out of chair. Neck pillow could have better mounting to keep it higher for taller people.","Good value, Small problems","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 17, 2023",True,4.0
B092DF433H,"So I bought this chair for my bf for Christmas. I did extensive research to find a good quality chair for his needs. This one fit all of it. Two months later after purchase two legs broke and I was devastated, but luckily I got a hold of a support team and they were great. I sent pictures and requested just 3 new legs but they sent all 5 and a new mount piece for the legs. Absolutely satisfied. Would recommend this product.",Great product and customer support,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 18, 2023",True,5.0
B092DF433H,"Got this thinking it looked sturdy and comfortable and not long after, the back just broke and whatever metal “support” in the chair itself that’s supposed to keep the back in place completely bent… waste of money.Edit:I ended up getting a refund and am changing my review because of how helpful and supportive AutoFull’s customer service was during this process. I chose not to order another chair out of fear that it would break again but it very well could have been a faulty product. While I had the chair, it was very comfortable and got rid of neck pain I was having due to the support it provided.",Edit: Broke after less than 3 months of use,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 2, 2023",True,4.0
B092DF433H,UPDATE: added another two stars because their after sales service is excellent. They reach out to me and offered a few options rectify the issue and even offered another free chair. This says a lot because most other companies will just take your money and run. I would give them another chance.Only reason Im giving this product two stars and not one is because it actually is comfortable..as MOST chairs are AT FIRST. Will be returning.QUALITY: None of the logos are centered or straight as you can see in my pictures. It was not stapled equality across all parts (you have more staples on one side than the other and at different location). Good quality products have a CONSISTENT PATTERN! Not to mention that one staple came broken as you can see by my thumb on the third picture.ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS: The instructions manual I receive was ONLY in Chinese. They charge you a prime for this chair but wont even bother to translate the manual. I did not order this in China and it was not delivered to china so there is no reason as to why the manual provided was ONLY written in Chinese.ARM REST: extremely uncomfortable.,Worst build quality / Excellent after sales support,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 8, 2023",True,4.0
B092DF433H,So comfortable and I can adjust so my feet touch floor at sewing machine table- I’m 5.4 and legs are short. I sit in this chair for 4-6 hours a day.I ordered armrest covers  (Milliard Ergonomic Office Chair Memory Foam Armrest Pad ) for more comfort and height- my arms are short and I use armrests a lot. Pullout footrest is okay … I tend to use my hassock instead to elevate my feet while hand sewing.Watched YouTube videos to put together- instruction booklet wasn’t great - difficult for 60 year old eyes to read!Love this chair!! Highly recommend!,Great chair for Craft room,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 15, 2023",True,5.0
B092DF433H,Overall good chair. I use it for work and gaming. Caster wheels are terrible though. I recommend replacing them if your budget allows.,Overall good chair.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 19, 2023",True,4.0
B092DF433H,"Hands down one of the easiest chairs I have assembled in a long time, all the required bolts were already where they needed to go, I just needed to remove them and put them back when assembling the chair. It also has to be one of the best chairs I have used for comfort/support, most chairs I used before this one made me slide into an uncomfortable position after a few minutes of usage, haven't had that issue with this chair and the lumbar pillow actually stays in place. If you have the disposable income, I would definitely recommend this chair for the ease of assembly and the comfort and support it gives. I'll update this post in 6 months on how I feel about the seat cushion and if it compresses in that time.",Best chair so far,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 28, 2023",True,5.0
