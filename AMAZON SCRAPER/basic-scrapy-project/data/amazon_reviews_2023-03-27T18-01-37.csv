B00NLZUM36,"Product is awesome. Works fantastically. No issues at all, and functions as it's supposed to. My only complaint is how it was shipped. It was sent via USPS and not through Amazon itself, which caused a lot of problems. First, the package was way too big to fit inside a mailbox (obviously) but it also could not fit inside a parcel mailbox either, and I was forced to retrieve it from the post office. Items like this are better sent via Amazon's own delivery service, or Fedex, etc. USPS is not designed to deliver large packages. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.",Great keyboard.

B00NLZUM36,Updated after enough use to adequately review 12/10/22:The keys are a tad bit too small. The mouse after one day - right mouse button sticks. I use it to toggle zoom so I don't press and hold it I just tap it. The left button does have a satisfying click and the resolution of the mouse improved gaming performance by an order of magnitude.Interesting but true - see picture - this keyboard has two R keys. The left R key is actually the E key.I can touch type on the keyboard but it takes some getting used to because of the small size of the keys and the smaller than usual spacing. I will live with it for a while but I should have bought a mechanical keyboard.This will definitely improve your gaming performance if you are currently using any form of wireless mouse. I was using Logitech M510 wireless gaming mouse and a Logitech ergonomic keyboard and they both experienced latency and connection issues.Overall very satisfied.,Great Upgrade at Great Price,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 9, 2022",True,4.0

B00NLZUM36,"Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the ""you get what you pay for"" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange ""tall"" type that relocates the ""\"" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. ""#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?"" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... ""What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return"". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.","You cannot get a better keyboard and mouse combo in this price range, I am certain of it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2016",True,5.0

B00NLZUM36,"This is a great keyboard. My Logitech stopped working after a few years, and I needed a replacement.  I figured I would get the same one but when I looked it up it was 120 dollars that I didn't have.  I saw this one had great reviews and for under 40 dollars I decided to give it a shot.  I spent a lot of time using the computer, and I game a LOT.  It's not clicky, but I can still feel the press of each key when I'm using it.  I love the low profile buttons.  The lighting is beautiful, I rotate through a few of the different colors and lighting effects.  My favorites are the pastel rainbow, and the mode that slowly fades through each color on a rotation. My one and only complaint would be that the finish on the keys is wearing off.  I've only had this for two months now, and as you can see by my picture, the paint on the WASD and space bar is wearing off in places.  The corners of the 2 and 3 buttons are also wearing off as my nail hits against it when I'm hitting my W key.  But again, I game a LOT, as I said.  I am very hard on this thing, so a bit of wear is kind of expected.  If they sell replacement keys I would absolutely buy them because I really enjoy this keyboard.

B00NLZUM36,"First, this review is for the replacement keyboard. The first one, the space bar didn't work, but the style and design are good, I figured I'd give it another try.Disclaimer, I have not tried as a gaming keyboard functions yet. This review is just for regular keyboard and mouse function.-Pros: Quiet, good feel while typing, keys feel like a mechanical keyboard without the loud clicking, back lighting is descent.  A nice looking unit.The mouse is stylish, and will work good ""as is"" but you need to download the free driver and suite (suite loads with the driver). once suite is loaded the mouse becomes very adjustable to your needs.-Cons: Had read other buyers say they had same problem with space bar and other other keys. To me, a keyboard should be about typing first, everything else second. Just me. but this second one works is great. Can't find anything else to complain about, but again this doesn't cover the gaming functions.The mouse. The mouse comes with the LED set to ""slow"" pulse. so if you don't download the driver (suite built in) you have a standard mouse with a red ""heart beat"" back light (default setting). Yes, the light for the mouse can only be controlled from the suite! As I stated it was free Red Dragon site, and installed quick and easy....on my personal laptop.I work remote now and work on a company computer as well. I usually just pop the USB hub from one to the other.But can't put the driver on work computer. Enter mouse with a red ""heart beat"" light for 8 hours.Good for your personal computer, but probably not for a work environment. Will have to live with it for now.Included instructions are basic at best, and even going on YouTube couldn't find a lot of help with what all the programmable/gaming keys could do.-Overall, good value for the price, as my son sent over $120 on his gaming keyboard (SMH).I would just advise to buy ""sold by Amazon"" as I got my replacement within two days.Updated (09/14/2020) On work computer, running large cad program and multiple file docs, along with other programs. The mouse was very glitchy. I realized running though the USB hub made the mouse commands even moving the cursor  “wait in line” to be executed. Not a long delay, but long enough to be aggravating. Computer is brand new, top self HP. So not the computer. Never had this problem with my wireless trackball mouse, with dongle plugged into hub. Not sure if this is all wired mouses or just this one. But I plugged it straight into one of the computers USB ports and now it works fine. Just a heads up.

I am not a perfect typist but have been doing it over 20 yrs so I am ok.That said this combo had some things going for it and some not so.The keyboard- took me a few minutes to adjust from my prior and fingers and movements fell right in nice, nice to type on almost dead silent, key pressure is about perfect in the middle for most, the lights are mostly nice color schemes, colors and brightness can all be changed super easy. The extra buttons are nice to have also.The negatives , you must use the light if you want to see the printing of the letters and numbers at all, the top number row the symbols can be a little hard to see even with brightest color, the front of it is not for me I would have preferred it flat as it’s too short to be an effective wrist rest so I have my normal keyboard wrist rest in front of it, that is my biggest gripe.The mouse to me is fine, nothing bad but not great either, I see some dislike for it but maybe some don’t realize the small button behind the scroll wheel if you press it then it changes the dpi mouse movement speed it has 3 settings, no need to download any software to do that.

B00NLZUM36,"Ok, so I bought this keyboard and mouse combo from Red Dragon back in March 2020. I wanted to spend most of my money on the CPU, graphics card, etc... so I didn't have a ton of money to spend on a badass keyboard and mouse. Plus this was the first actual PC I built that didn't run like a potato. When I found this keyboard and mouse combo for only $30, I was shocked and a bit skeptical. I ordered it thinking it was going to be complete crap and would have to upgrade soon after, but I was wrong! Sure if you ask any pro gamers they would say it's crap, but to me, it was and still is (for the most part) amazing. Much nicer than I thought a $30 keyboard and mouse combo would be. I will say that after about one and a half years of ownership (and daily use), the keyboard still works perfectly fine and has no issues whatsoever. The mouse, however, I can't say the same for. The mouse was great I but noticed about a month ago, the rear side button started getting stuck and not working properly. I died a few times in Call of Duty Warzone because of it and couldn't go back to my previous pages when sifting through my web browser. So I decided it was time to throw it away and get an upgrade. Other than that rear side button giving out and getting stuck, the mouse still worked fine, but I decided I wanted an upgrade anyway to a better mouse with customizable RGB lighting. The keyboard has good customizable RGB lighting options but the mouse was always one solid color, red. Overall, this combo is amazing for beginners! Primarily for someone who doesn't want to spend too much money on a keyboard and mouse that can also be used for daily work, school work, and gaming purposes. Thanks for getting me started Red Dragon!",Great beginners keyboard and mouse!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 27, 2021",True,4.0
B00NLZUM36,"If you can spare two USB ports, this set is a fantastic bargain.  Maybe there's more customization on more expensive gaming keyboards - this is my first step into the field.  However, everything works great and I honestly have no complaints.  It exceeded my expectations so far (A month or two of use so far).2020 Update:I liked my first Redragon set enough to buy a second set for at work.  The price is still right, and everything still looks and feels great.  A few things have changed, though.The keyboard is now RGB backlit rather than plain unlit keys with red LED embellishments.  There are FN controls to regulate the ""breathing"" (light-dark pulsing) of the keyboard, which is good because I found it distracting.  The included instruction booklet lists these key combinations.  FN+END pauses and unpauses breathing.  FN+PGDN enables and disables the backlight entirely.  FN+PGUP rotates through 3 still rainbow lighting arrangements.  FN+HOME rotates through 7 monochromatic colors (white, blue, red, green, purple, yellow, and cyan).  FN+INS smoothly transitions through the 7 colors over the course of a few seconds, though to my eyes the brightness was uneven.  FN+UP and FN+DN scale through 4 levels of brightness, and FN+LEFT and FN+RIGHT scale through 4 speeds of animation.For my money, the backlight will be kept motionless on a monochrome light, but to each their own.All told, very happy with the keyboard.  It also features two new sets of buttons above the F-row, which are oddly not backlit.  The set to left of center includes links to My Computer, Search, Refresh, Email, Calculator, and Home Page.  The keys to the right are media controls for Stop, Last Track, Play/Pause, and Next Track.  These are all fine, but unnecessary since the F-row already has FN shortcuts to most of these things, and the topmost row, again, isn't backlit.And we have the mouse.  It feels identical to the previous mouse, though it has 4 DPI settings rather than 3.  There's a catch though, which is that the mouse backlight (red only) is set to ""breathe"" by default.  To disable this, you'll need to download software from the Redragon support page.  Although my mouse and keyboard both list their parts # as S101-3, the mouse is actually a M601-3 CENTROPHORUS.  You'll need to download the drivers for this mouse in order to disable breathing.  All the way left on the software's slider will disable the light fully, and all the way right will leave it permanently backlit (my preference).  The other new thing with the mouse is that a LED flashes when you change DPI; it's flash speed correlating to how high the DPI is.  It seems unnecessary but harmless.All told, my first impression is that the addition of pulsing lights just makes first time setup harder as you need to track down the software for the mouse and learn the keyboard controls.  I want to take off a half point for the mouse not having a hardware option to disable the light, but all told I'll keep my rating at a 5 as the backlit keys are actually an improvement once you learn how to freeze them.*****",Need a super keyboard and mouse for under $30?

B00NLZUM36,"The S101 keyboard and mouse combo is a nice and affordable replacement for a basic keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is very basic with no software to program it. All of the LED lighting commands are built-in to the keyboard using FN keys and are very basic. The mouse has software and drivers you can download to program macros, assign buttons, adjust speed, LED light, etc. However, the mouse is just one LED color...red. The keyboard has nice multicolor LED options. Both the keyboard and mouse feel like they are made well and durable. I like the feel of the keys when I type on them, it's also very quiet. Happy with this purchase.",A good and inexpensive wired USB keyboard/mouse combo.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 7, 2022",True,4.0
