It replaces a well-loved, well-used MacBook Air from 2015. Its limited I/O capabilities really get in the way. such a disappointment. Apple clearly is focused on form over function.Unlike the earlier system, this system only has two ports for peripheral devices and charging.  So, if you'd like to attach a power cord, a time machine drive, and anything else, you need to purchase a USB-C docking station.  What a pain!Since previous generations of Time Machine devices used USB-A connectors and this machine doesn't have one, setting up the machine is much, much more painful than necessary.  One has to purchase and received a dongle to attach a USB-A device.Furthermore, all of the dongles I've purchased over the years to attach devices need to be purchased again because they support lightening, USB-A or Micro USB rather than USB C.The transport company didn't communicate with me about the delivery and expected me to sit at home for 12 hours waiting for the driver to arrive so that I could accept the box and sign for it.

{"asin": "B0B3C5HNXJ", "text": "Apple has taken a sharp downward spiral, their products used to be top notch, but now they fail at almost every task. Word processing tasks are abysmal, photo editing is slow at best, and multitasking is out of the question. MacBook Pro\u2019s are now a chrome book with a fancy screen resolution. They are all fluff and no substance, which is sad when they used to be excellent for most editing and word processing jobs. As a photojournalist I expect to be able to batch edit multiple images and continue writing captions or a news article at the same time. No longer with Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Pro. This piece of junk makes a better paper weight than it does a laptop. Don\u2019t waste your time or money, these new products from Apple leave much to be desired. Not to mention the frustration from waiting for the text that you typed to show up on the screen ten seconds later. I am transitioning away from an all Apple setup which I have built over the past 10 years. Not by choice I must add! I am really disappointed in the quality of this computer.
