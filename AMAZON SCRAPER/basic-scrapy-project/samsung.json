{"asin": "B09MVZH5RB", "text": "Got my husband this phone as an early birthday/Christmas gift. He\u2019s never had a phone that cost more than $400 and this present came as a big surprise. After seeing the camera and screen quality, I\u2019m probably going to jump ship on the iPhone bandwagon I\u2019ve been on for the last decade once I\u2019m up for an upgrade. I seriously cannot emphasize how great the picture quality is and the sound is incredible. I downloaded tiktok and snapchat on it, to see if posted videos lagged (like all typical androids) but they actually looked crispier on the 22+ Ultra than my iPhone 13+\u2026 Only downside that my husband immediately noticed was the size and mentioned how probable a drop was going to be, but I got him a durable case and popsocket that\u2019s hopefully helps mitigate that. He won\u2019t stop thanking me for the gift so it\u2019s safe to say that this was worth the investment! Now the only reason why I\u2019m unwilling to rate it 5 stars is because the 45W charger isn\u2019t included with the phone to aid fast battery charging and Samsung downgraded the ram from 12GB to 8GB from last year\u2019s Galaxy S21 5G Ultra\u2026 obviously not a big difference but these changes just prove the company wants to siphon more money out of consumers.", "title": "5 Star Quality but 4 Star Overall", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on November 20, 2022", "verified": true, "rating": "4.0"},
