{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': "I have literally bought 5+ pair of Sennheiser MX-680 over the years, because they sound great, and work for my purposes with same situation Sansa Clip+ MP3 players (way more than 5+) for about 12 years. Both of those devices are rare now, and I am facing the fact that it's time to get into the modern era. I download about 25 podcasts on Sunday to listen to while I toil at my job all week. I have tested and returned several devices in the last month or so, but I have held on to these earbeans. If you have seen or own a set, you know why I refer to them as earbeans. They sound and/or fit better than 3 other wireless sets that I have tried. More consistent bluetooth connections with several devices, and may even sound better than the wired Sennheisers on my gaming laptop... They tend to work their way out of my ears gradually requiring me to push them back in a little after a couple hours, but it beats the alternative of having my ears clogged with silicone ear tips which I don't care for. Weirdest thing I have to complain about is that when I go outdoors, the bluetooth connection gets real flukey. I don't understand it, but when I am indoors or in a car, it's perfect. When I step outside, it's in and out (same with Raycons which I tested at the same time)... Finally, when paired with my Galaxy S8 (yes I am old and don't buy a new phone every year or less), I can't seem to get them loud enough, but I think that's the nanny nature of the phone not wanting to damage one's hearing and not so much the earbeans because they will go much louder on the PC... Take it from someone who will reject anything of questionable quality, these are good. Raycon on the other hand (at $55 more) - going back.", 'title': 'Noob with BlueTooth Earbuds somewhat impressed with these EARBEANS!', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 25, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': 'These earbuds are different from most that they don\'t require a rubber plug to sit directly in the ear canal. IF the shape of your ears is compatible, they sit in a bend of the outer ear. The online manual shows and illustration whereby the buds are held "correctly" in a more or less vertical position, and "incorrectly" in a more horizontal position. There\'s no way that the earbuds will provide good sound in my ears in the "correct" position, but luckily the "incorrect" position is fine. I would not expect the full fidelity of a pair of expensive in-ear earbuds, but they are certainly sufficient for casual listening to music, and have sufficient bass and treble response. I especially like that they can be charged in their battery-containing case, and that the case itself can be charged wirelessly with or without the earbuds inside. As far as noise cancellation is concerned, that is not what I purchased these earbuds for, and I would imagine it would not be anywhere nearest effective as something that creates an actual physical seal. I find that I can walk around with them without having to worry about them falling out, but as far as intense physical activity, probably not.

{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': "Enjoy taking these with me everywhere, as the case easily fits in any pocket. The earbuds sit well in my ear, and provide great volume; turning earbud volume on high and phone volume on high hurts, usually have both about half. A little on the touch sensitive side, as earbuds often pause or skip music, even if that's not what I intended. These earbuds have a noise canceling function, but that's not the primary design (suggest getting something else, if that's your primary reason). Battery life is excellent for their size; used continually for almost 5 hours (noise canceling function off). Case will completely recharge earbuds twice, without being plugged in. The only complaint is that I have to constantly adjust the earbuds if I'm doing rigorous exercise or work; they've fallen out during runs.

{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': "Very pleased with these! The SQ is more than adequate. Listen to a wide range of music, from electronic, bass heavy tracks to soft jazz, these allow me to seamlessly engage with the music. Due to their open back design they give you a sense of airyness - the music seems to be around you rather than in your ears. This makes them phenomenal for watching movies. If you are after pure SQ the Sennheiser CX400BT have a more natural, balanced sound (nothing I've tried beats the Sennheisers in SQ), but the Galaxy Buds are more engaging and fun. There is no denying there is a professionally built sound in these! They also play louder and fit firmer, hence better for workouts. Are very comfy for long listening sessions (no pressure in your ears because they don't create a vacuumed seal) and are slim so you can lay on a pillow without them pushing into your ear. They also come packed with a bunch of features - you can adjust the controls, can find them through the app and can adjust the EQ through well designed presets. Can't say how much exactly they leak sound, but I wouldn't worry about it too much given the benefits and uniqueness of open-back design. The fact they don't block out the environment is a welcome feature for me because I don't have to take them out of my ears to have a conversation. I also don't mind hearing what is going on around me. Not for everyone, but definitely an excellent design some will appreciate.

It's nice to have ambient awareness without expending battery power to produce it, which is what happens with in-ear earbuds.The people dissing the ANC are missing the point.  The objective of these buds is to knock out low frequency background noise, not provide total isolation.  And they do an awesome job of that without eliminating the things you want to hear - like a flight announcement.To me, the sound quality is great.  The openness creates the impression of a much larger space.Battery life is a little disappointing.  With all features turned off, I expected close to eight hours use.  I pretty much killed a charge in about 5 hrs.  3.5hrs of that was a Zoom call, but the literature doesn't lead you to expect shorter life from calls.  Fortunately, you can use the buds individually, so can alternate if you can stand using one at a time.Also,I had the app active on my phone.  I think the battery life would be a little better with the app turned off.  Going to try that next.I've tried a bunch of earbuds.  These are by far the closest I've seen to perfect for my needs.

{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': 'I was looking for a wireless earbud that didn\'t go into the ear canal, like the Apple airpods.  I read in reviews that these are good for people who have smaller ears and I purchased these for a teenage girl.  They did not fit.  These buds, however, are hot garbage especially compared to the airpods (I\'m normally not a fan of apple products) in so many ways.-- The Sound --They are very mid heavy.  The airpods are as well but overall the sound is much higher quality on the airpods.  It may have to do with the design.  Mine came with the bass boost EQ set by default.  The sound stage is ok for an earbud, probably because there\'s no seal.  However, there is missing ranges all over the place.  And there is no way, from the Samsung Wear app, to make a custom EQ.  You have to pick from the pre-set EQ options and none of them are very good.  Neutral is missing massive amounts of high end and many of the other options are too bass heavy so I went with "clear" which is the least offensive.  Even on "clear" EQ setting, listening to an Audible book was giving me a headache because of the poor tuning on these buds.To give some perspective, I use Sony wf-1000xm3\'s as my primary bluetooth earbuds and 7hz Timeless as my primary wired set (The Timeless annihilate the Sony\'s but wireless have their place).  The Sony\'s are a little more expensive than these and sound waaaay better.  Heck, the regular Samsung Buds sound better than these and are more comfortable for more people.I think if you really don\'t care about the sound quality too much and they fit your ears really comfortably, then enjoy because some of the features are nice and battery is ok too.  If you\'re looking for better for less, look elsewhere.-- Comfort --If these fit your ears then they have the potential to be very comfortable.  However, of the 5 people I\'ve had try these on, they only were comfortable for 1 person who had medium-small ears.  They did not fit the teenager at all and would fall out after a few seconds.  Nor did they fit my ears as the charging bump pushes them into an awkward angle to my ear and they start bothering me after a few minutes.  Your mileage will vary in the comfort of these depending on your ear size and shape.', 'title': 'With so many better alternatives, why these?', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '1.0'}

{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': "When I bought this product I thought it'll be a change from the silicone tip buds that I usually wear; those which go directly inside your ear and cause discomfort after a short amount of time. Upon trying the Samsung Galaxy buds Live, the bean structure did not sit comfortably in my ear. Because it doesn't have a silicone tip and doesn't go directly inside your earhole, it's very loose and will fall off if you run, jump, or do the slightest bit of cardio. Moreover, the beans themselves are a bit larger and slightly heavier than your usual buds - possibly a third bigger than your standard google pixel buds or air pods.  And unlike the silicone tip buds that we're often used to, the speakers for the Galaxy live are located on one side of the bean. So you really can't twist around too much to get that level of comfort and secureness. And because it doesn't go directly inside your ear, the speaker feels very distant, and the sound quality is not as immersive as a typical air pod or pixel bud. What's the point of noise cancellation if the product itself doesn't sit comfortably in your ear. I feel like if I tap the bean for calls, it'll fall off my ear anytime. Due to its odd shape, size, and location of the speakers, the galaxy buds live is not gym or workout friendly, and the sound quality lacks because of it. Personally I think standard silicone buds that go directly in your ear are not as uncomfortable as people say it is. And I would personally choose the galaxy buds pro or 2 over this one.

The music was also clear, no problems with the different genres I tested.After the first hours of use, they started hurting my ears, this was quite uncomfortable, but it ended up disappearing after a couple of days, thankfully.Now, here's what the deal breaker was for me... Noise cancellation. I'm used to the rubber tips and the way they block noises. These buds have nothing for a tip to be added. Due to the lack of this rubber tips, all kinds of noises can be heard, since the ear canal is not completely blocked. I HATED THIS. Tried them for a week, couldn't stand it.
