So while building my new computer, I decided to purchase a wireless keyboard/mouse combo. I ordered from a name I never heard of before. Big mistake. The keyboard and mouse were cheap and did not work as advertised. I then found a ReDragon wireless keyboard/mouse combo and quickly decided to buy it.This combo is solid and well built and works quite well. The one and only drawback is that the mouse requires 2 AA batteries. The keyboard charges with a USB cable. I was hoping that the mouse would also charge with a USB cable.

You have to hit a key to light it back up which can be problematic if you hit the wrong key and ruin what you are trying to accomplish in the game. Also th mouse doesn't slide smoothly. It's very difficult to get an accurate shot when you need to move the cross hair just a tiny bit and can't. Also in order to wake up the mouse you have to click the button which is usually the attack or shoot buttons. Not good for gaming. Most I've used all you have to do is move the mouse not accidentally shoot or hit something becauseyou have to click the mouse buttons to wake it up. I could go on and on.
