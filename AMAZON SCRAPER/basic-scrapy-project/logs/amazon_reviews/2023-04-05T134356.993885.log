{'asin': 'B09RB9Z4Z2', 'text': "I purchased the GE67 HX with the OLED panel back in early December 2022 but I wanted to use it for at least two months before writing my review. I'm happy to say the laptop has been solid from the start. It's especially great for gaming, given the OLED panel's 240hz refresh rate and super low response times. I bought the MSI to replace my 2019 Razer Blade 15, also with an OLED panel but with slower refresh rate because 2019. I went with MSI this time because it was a good deal and also I wanted a thicker laptop with more room for cooling. Sure the fans get loud during gaming but the performance is absolutely top notch in fast fps games and this MSI averages temps that are quite a bit cooler on average (I monitor these with Throttlestop and Afterburner) than my 2019 super thin Razer Blade 15. I use both on a laptop stands while gaming for the best airflow. If the fans are too loud for you, MSI also allows you to set custom fan profiles in MSI center so you can adjust based on your preferences. Overall this MSI is a solid choice for the gamer or person who wants a portable workstation PC.", 'title': 'Powerful laptop with the best screen (240hz OLED 1ms) for gaming.', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 17, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B09RB9Z4Z2', 'text': "Saw so many video reviews on Youtube before buying; the main gripes were the screen isn't bright enough, and the fans are too loud.Reports of <400 nits brightness are WRONG.  This unit is rated at and delivers 600 nits, with 500 nits being the industry average, its above.  There is (was) a bug with MSI True Color washing out the HDR, but there is (was) a fix that is well documented by MSI.  I fixed mine in minutes.  HDR content is awesome and dynamic, and the OLED screen is just intoxicating.  You won't want to look at an LED screen again.To address the fan loudness issue, unless you are playing a AAA game with ultra settings, this will not be an issue.  Chances are you will have an external sound source or headphones, so it won't matter anyway.Leading into this: The only small gripe I have with this laptop is that the built in speakers are not very loud at all.  They are usable and sound fine, but you will want to get your sound from somewhere else when it is convenient.Otherwise, this thing crushes games and is a great machine all around, and I cannot say enough how amazing the 120Hz OLED screen is for gaming.  It is so smooth.  I don't want to play at 60Hz ever again!Without going to the super-expensive range of laptop out there, this one is a deal for under $2500.

{'asin': 'B09RB9Z4Z2', 'text': "This is the most honest review of this product you will find. I bought this in August via another channel. Short version is its been back to MSI twice, the problems persist and I have spent countless hours trying to solve them.As a qualifier - I was upgrading from a MSI GE66SFS I bought in 2022 that has worked perfectly since day one. I have gone back to that model. MSI's customer support has been very good and I am reviewing just this product. I was able to identify 2 problems that were deal breakers for me:1. I was unable to ever get wireless headphones to work in any game without static to the point it was unusable. I would end up having to plug into the 3.5mm jack with my Arctis Pro Wireless. I bought both Nova Pro Wireless and Razer Blackshark Pro Wireless with the same results. Bluetooth also had the same results. This was true with the dongle directly connected directly to the laptop. I removed the laptop and tested at other locations to rule out outside RF interference. Seems like a hardware issue. Outside of games it was fine.2. I work from home as an IT professional and Cybersecurity Expert. I use a KVM. This model ships with a Steelseries keyboard. Using any KVM (I tested 4 different models all purchased new with the same results) causes the usb to completely fail. My keyboard is a Steelseries Apex Pro TKL. I used a Razer Basilisk mouse and the afore mentioned headphones. Again, outside of games was fine. Connecting the KVM and just the keyboard causes a failure.What I would say is its specific to this model. My older GE66 has none of these issues. It worked fine with my KVM with audio passing through it in the exact same setup in the exact same environment. I could literally plug this one in to the same setup and have the issues described, swap for the GE66 and have no issues at all. I thought maybe it was related to win 11 (The GE66 has win 10). I rolled it back to Win 10, installed the drivers and had the exact same issues.For MSIs part, they serviced it twice, replacing the motherboard the second time. The issues persisted. The first time they were responsive, the second not as much until I got a good tech who believed me. Overall I would buy another MSI based on their service and my GE66 experience, and this model is amazing if you don't plan on using wireless or a KVM. The OLED screen is amazing and I really wanted to like it. I would recommend sticking with a new GE66 (or GP66) over this if you want MSI.Maybe it's just mine. Not everyone will use it in the way I do. For me it was a desktop replacement I could grab and go when needed.
