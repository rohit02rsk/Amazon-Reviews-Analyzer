I will be using this service again for future phones. Just a word to the wise, NEVER SHOP AT BEST BUY. We ordered same phone same price refurbished, delivery to store would take a week. Got call next day that it was ready, called store they claim it wasn‚Äôt there. Called customer service said it was delivered and signed for. Waited a few days and got an update saying it was prepping for pick up but several days went by and still no status change. We go back and still they say no phone and it never got to the store. Called customer service yet again to find out Sammy signed for it days ago at the Southaven location. After dealing with this debacle we canceled order and reported as fraud. Turns out Sammy stole the phone and was trying to still charge our account. According to our bank this is not the first time Best Buy has done this.

{'asin': 'B09JFFG8D7', 'text': "UPDATE: I bought the premium renewed iphone for their one YEAR satisfaction GUARANTEE with free returns and a complete refund for any reason. I bought this in May of 2022 for $900 and returned this in December 2022 However after 3 weeks of waiting I finally got my refund for $794. After hours of being juggled between representatives I was finally told that there is a 100 dollar restocking fee despite no where anywhere was it explained that there would be a restocking fee. Amazon representatives on multiple times lied to me and refused to help resolve the situation the last person I spoke to Danica A in the Philippines claimed over our 40 mintue conversation that she was the head of Amazon worldwide customer service yet also saying that she had a supervisor but refused to connect me to them because they were not equipped to handle customer service issues....do you realize how insane that is she refused to give me any information that would allow me to report her to Amazon corporate office except her first name and last initial which was most likely a lie. I paid an extra 100 dollar (apprx) for the premium renewed plan but no one I spoke to even knew what that was. I cannot emphasize highly enough that you should avoid this at all cost because they will 100% screw you over bewhare do not do this do not buy this I can't emphatically explain to you enough why you need to avoid this. Unfortunately Amazons gotten so big and taken over so much of the market share that no one can compete with their prices so if I want a phone at a reasonable price I have to buy it from them. I've been a loyal customer for years and spent thousands of dollars of my money on them If I could never buy from them again I never would. That is how much they have damaged the customer loyalty bond. Just PLEASE BEWHARE what you risk if you go ahead and purchase something from them lies, deceit, manipulation, terrible service, financial loss, and hours of lost time being juggled between representatives.May 2022So this is my first experience with Amazon's renewed premium program where you pay between $50-$100 more than the renewed price but for that you get an item whose battery is at least at 90% capacity relative to a new one and instead of a 90 day warranty you get a year warranty and a year to return the item. For less than $100 I thought that was definitely worth it. However the first iPhone 12 pro they sent me had a battery that was at 85% capacity which really pissed me off because I felt cheated so I returned it and purchased it again and I'm glad I did because the 2nd ones battery was at 100% capacity and for all intents and purposes it was a brand new phone at a used price. Granted it's still really expensive it was $900 before tax but I got this to be future proof at least for the next several years. This is my first iPhone before I was all android phones but it seemed like every year I was having to buy another phone because something out of my control always happened but my parents still had their iPhone 8 that they bought new and it was still working perfectly. I haven't had this phone for more than a few days but so far I'm very impressed with it. The facial recognition capabilities are so good. My phone can recognize me when I'm in a dark room whereas my Samsung tablet can't recognize my face without all the lights on. One feature this phone doesn't have that really surprised me was that there is no built in fingerprint scanner and I think that was a mistake on apple's part. The battery is supposed to only last 21 hours but a full charge is lasting me a little over 2 days. The screen is gorgeous is it HDR Dolby Vision and HLG compatible and not even my 4k tv supports all of those so it makes streaming look brilliant. You can see every detail even though the screen is 6.7inches. it seems like everyday I'm finding out a new function that this phone has granted a lot them I'll never use because I don't use my phone that way but it's cool to know that if I wanted to I could if I so choosed. I guess I'll stop my review here because you get the gist and I hate it when people on Amazon beat a dead horse and I don't want to be one of those so Amazon renewed premium is a worthwhile program and the iPhone 12 pro max is an awesome phone that's worth the investment.", 'title': 'Took twice but it was worth it! update Jan 2023', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 23, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '1.0'}

{'asin': 'B09JFFG8D7', 'text': 'I had the exact same experience as Mr. Philip Chaplin. I was refunded $770 for a $947 phone. The phone\'s mic had issues. I was obviously not satisfied with the purchase. Getting it picked up by the carrier for return was a hassle. It was sitting nicely packed with me for 2 months because Amazon wouldn\'t allow anything other than a pickup. Frustrated, I escalated the issue and finally a manager created a drop-off label for me.Now, Amazon receives it and refunds me 80%. Now starts a series of calls and emails with Amazon where I have to explain to reps about their own renewed premium policy. Many don\'t know that it exists. So what do they do? They do 2 things- 1. they lie by saying I\'m past the 30-day return window (remember, it\'s a renewed premium product with 365 days window), so I\'m charged restocking fee. 2. after me telling them about amazon\'s renewed guarantee and upon seeing they were wrong, they then lie by saying I returned a damaged product. On asking to be sent the damage details via email, there\'s no answer.It\'s a cycle of lies and incompetence by Amazon customer service. The reps avoid my request when asked to escalate the issue. They keep repeating the same thing- "our system is not allowing to process a refund for the restocking fee because the item is past the return window." Well, WHY was I even charged the fee when the return window is 365 days!? Then again it\'s the same cycle that starts with me explaining them about renewed premium. What is even the point of renewed premium when you were falsely advertised to and not issued full refund, which is promised by Amazon?Every time, the story starts from scratch- explain to them about the situation, and they place me on hold to check details and then for them to tell me it\'s past the return window.

{'asin': 'B09JFFG8D7', 'text': 'Cuando uno compra un art√≠culo tiene ciertas expectativas sobre √©l. En este caso, bajo la promesa de ser un art√≠culo reacondicionado premium y de ser vendido y enviado por Amazon, esperaba que al menos cumpliera con lo escrito en la descripci√≥n.En primer lugar, el embalaje del producto protege a la perfecci√≥n el contenido del paquete, no obstante, sent√≠ algo de ansiedad al no ver que en alg√∫n lugar dijera "premium", por lo que pens√© que tal vez pagu√© m√°s dinero (de hecho a√∫n tengo la duda) y me enviaron un reacondicionado cualquiera.Cuando abr√≠ el paquete me dispuse a verificar el tel√©fono y todo result√≥ (o eso cre√≠) excelente. Al encender el tel√©fono por primera vez, √©ste no prendi√≥ ni dio se√±ales de vida. Me asust√©, aunque conserve la calma y lo puse a cargar. Proced√≠ a revisarlo mientras tanto. Est√©tica 10/10. Una vez con carga, empec√© una an√°lisis m√°s profundo: al parecer, todas las piezas originales, cero rayones y funcionalidad sin ning√∫n problema. Todo bien hasta que record√© la principal raz√≥n de elegir un reacondicionado premium: la bater√≠a. Revisando en ajustes me di cuenta del √∫nico gran detalle: el porcentaje de bater√≠a del dispositivo es del 86%.Me molest√≥ bastante el hecho de pagar m√°s por la promesa de una bater√≠a de al menos el 90% y que me hayan enga√±ado con un porcentaje menor me parece de lo m√°s bajo por parte de Amazon. De hecho, pens√© en regresarlo el mismo d√≠a por tal motivo. Al final desist√≠ debido a que se me hacia engorroso el tema de garant√≠a de enviar a EUA, esperar a que lo reciban y revisen, a que me reembolsen y luego pedir otra vez el producto. Si bien ya ten√≠a presupuestado el cambio de bater√≠a en tal vez un par de a√±os, ahora ser√° mucho antes debido a la menor vida √∫til.En conclusi√≥n, el producto y la calidad en general son excelentes, sin embargo, la bater√≠a le resta much√≠simos puntos.
