It was sent via USPS and not through Amazon itself, which caused a lot of problems. First, the package was way too big to fit inside a mailbox (obviously) but it also could not fit inside a parcel mailbox either, and I was forced to retrieve it from the post office.

I use it to toggle zoom so I don't press and hold it I just tap it. The left button does have a satisfying click and the resolution of the mouse improved gaming performance by an order of magnitude.Interesting but true - see picture - this keyboard has two R keys. The left R key is actually the E key.I can touch type on the keyboard but it takes some getting used to because of the small size of the keys and the smaller than usual spacing. I will live with it for a while but I should have bought a mechanical keyboard.This will definitely improve your gaming performance if you are currently using any form of wireless mouse. I was using Logitech M510 wireless gaming mouse and a Logitech ergonomic keyboard and they both experienced latency and connection issues.Overall very satisfied.", 'title': 'Great Upgrade at Great Price', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}
