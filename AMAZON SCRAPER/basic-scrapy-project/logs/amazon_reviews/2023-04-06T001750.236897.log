{'asin': 'B091BCCTND', 'text': "I had previously owned a ReDragon keyboard and mouse combo, but it was wired and didn't have the number pad either. So while building my new computer, I decided to purchase a wireless keyboard/mouse combo. I ordered from a name I never heard of before. Big mistake. The keyboard and mouse were cheap and did not work as advertised. I then found a ReDragon wireless keyboard/mouse combo and quickly decided to buy it.This combo is solid and well built and works quite well. The one and only drawback is that the mouse requires 2 AA batteries. The keyboard charges with a USB cable. I was hoping that the mouse would also charge with a USB cable. But all in all, I'd recommend this set to anyone looking at it.", 'title': 'Love ReDragon keyboard and mouse', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 29, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

I also use it for work and it only lasted 24-25 hours when I left it unplugged.  -Ainâ€™t nobody got time to charge that- so now I leave it plugged in all the time. No place to put batteries in.The mouse is freaking crazy awesome in battery life. I set off batteries and itâ€™s still going strong. (I do turn both off when Iâ€™m done for the day) One thing I didnâ€™t like so much was the sensitivity of the mouse when it first arrived but that has gone away now.Overall Iâ€™m happy with the purchase.
