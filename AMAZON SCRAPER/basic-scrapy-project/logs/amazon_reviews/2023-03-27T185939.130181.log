{'asin': 'B093KXNPFB', 'text': 'This is my 5th tv I’ve had to return several I bought directly from samsung and two from here. When this tv first came out I was so excited to purchase it, I pre-ordered it but once it arrived the television had obviously been opened and put back together before it got to me. The screen protruded from the metal frame. The glue that seals the tv was coming out the frame itself was warped and there were fingerprints on the inside of the screen. The next tv I got had horrible DSE (dirty screen effect) that resulted in very noticeable banding whenever the camera panned across the screen.  The next replacement I received had a glowing white line down the middle. Common sense says I should have given up but I really wanted to love this tv. The last model I returned the backlight bled through the screen, so whatever you watched you could see a faint grid of dots bleeding through. The corners of the infinity display weren’t sealed off so light bled out around the thin black bezels. The set I currently have is the least messed up of all I’ve received but still has a faint grey line that shows up on solid dark colors and the same noticeable banding when the camera pans, the tv also gets suddenly dim even though auto brightness is turned off. The only reason I haven’t yet returned the set I have is because Of the ptsd I have from mounting and unmounting the previous 4 sets. The quality control on these sets is nonexistent. Samsung’s customer service is appalling, which is what made me purchase on Amazon. For a tv that’s supposed to be Samsung’s highest end consumer offering disappointing is an understatement.

I am in the market for a new television and have been doing many hours of research. I have visited two businesses that have this television on display.

I want the largest screen I can get at a price point that doesn’t require a second mortgage. That puts me in the 85 inch range for LED and 83 inch for OLED. I say this because I am a Samsung fan and with the exception of one or two sets over the years, I have always gravitated to Samsung. Samsung largest OLED right now is 83 inches.After exhaustive auditioning of sets, I had settled on the 83 inch OLED and was ready to pull the trigger. Then they announced this 85 inch 8K model and I had to give it my attention. As I said, I was able to experience this television in person with a couple very knowledgeable salespersons.Let me tell you, when I first saw the picture on this set, I was blown away. The colors are so accurate and the brightness will blow you away. OLED is well known for the blackest blacks but you do not necessarily get a bright picture. With my current OLED, the room truly needs to be dark to get the most out of the picture. This 8K delivered the same deep blacks and also provided incredible contrast in really dark scenes. So many movies lately are just one dark scene after another and this set is outstanding in its ability to still let you see the varying shades of black and dark gray. On my current sets, they are just a muddy mess.I want to address something I read in a review. This television DOES provide an 8K picture despite what some have said. You have to be plugged in to a particular HDMI port to do so and if you don’t delve deep into the instructions and settings, you could miss this information. Now I do understand that there is not much true 8K content out there and many people will overlook this set due to that issue. There are some YouTube videos that claim to be 8K but when they were played on this set, they did not impress me. When a video that was recorded with a high dollar 8K camera was played back, again, mind blown. The upconversion of Ultra HD 4K video was also impressive. I brought along several DVDs that I have watched numerous times to test this.I took a friend along on one of my visits and he bought the set on the spot so I now have untold hours trying out this set with all types of content with one exception.

{'asin': 'B093KXNPFB', 'text': 'I want to be fair and start this review with a few facts. I did not buy this television…yet. I am in the market for a new television and have been doing many hours of research. I have visited two businesses that have this television on display. These are not big box stores but dedicated audio/video companies.Many of my acquaintances have projection setups and those are not for me. I want the largest screen I can get at a price point that doesn’t require a second mortgage. That puts me in the 85 inch range for LED and 83 inch for OLED. I say this because I am a Samsung fan and with the exception of one or two sets over the years, I have always gravitated to Samsung. Samsung largest OLED right now is 83 inches.After exhaustive auditioning of sets, I had settled on the 83 inch OLED and was ready to pull the trigger. Then they announced this 85 inch 8K model and I had to give it my attention. As I said, I was able to experience this television in person with a couple very knowledgeable salespersons.Let me tell you, when I first saw the picture on this set, I was blown away. The colors are so accurate and the brightness will blow you away. OLED is well known for the blackest blacks but you do not necessarily get a bright picture. With my current OLED, the room truly needs to be dark to get the most out of the picture. This 8K delivered the same deep blacks and also provided incredible contrast in really dark scenes. So many movies lately are just one dark scene after another and this set is outstanding in its ability to still let you see the varying shades of black and dark gray. On my current sets, they are just a muddy mess.I want to address something I read in a review. This television DOES provide an 8K picture despite what some have said. You have to be plugged in to a particular HDMI port to do so and if you don’t delve deep into the instructions and settings, you could miss this information. Now I do understand that there is not much true 8K content out there and many people will overlook this set due to that issue. There are some YouTube videos that claim to be 8K but when they were played on this set, they did not impress me. When a video that was recorded with a high dollar 8K camera was played back, again, mind blown. The upconversion of Ultra HD 4K video was also impressive. I brought along several DVDs that I have watched numerous times to test this.I took a friend along on one of my visits and he bought the set on the spot so I now have untold hours trying out this set with all types of content with one exception. Neither of us plays video games, nor do we own any video consoles or gaming computers so I cannot speak to that.I love this set. It is the best I have ever seen. I would have already bought it if it weren’t for one issue. This set is HEAVY. Samsung. It felt like much more when I had to help unbox it, install the feet and lift it onto a stand. I would be terrified to hang this on a wall. It is going to require either an industrial rolling cart or a very large, super sturdy piece of furniture.', 'title': 'Absolute must buy', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 9, 2022', 'verified': False, 'rating': '5.0'}
