I love having armrests that can flip out of the way if needed.  The chair lifts or lowers to the desired height and can rock back and forth.  The cushioning, although it felt stiff at first, is just right for good support and comfort.  I have an injured tailbone and find it amazingly comfortable without using my cushion pad.  The chair fits my petite size (5\'3").  The gray and white color blends well into my home decor.

The elevating spindle on my second hand luxury chair was going bad, so I began looking around the net.  Other reviews indicated this was an excellent chair for a low price. With many favorable ratings to its credit I decided to purchase it.  I can report that it is very satisfactory.  It is light enough to move around with ease, even from room to room. Viewing the wheel casters online, I was worried about their strength, as they look a little flimsy in pictures.  However, the casters turned out to be very substantial.  After viewing the online video showing its assembly, it was no problem to put the chair together.  I like it, for the usable value and low price.

{'asin': 'B0BCNLGVMH', 'text': 'Working from home half time and trying to find the best ergonomic set up for small space.  I’m 5’3” and found the adjustable chair height good, but I believe my desk is too tall for proper ergonomics and I have to use a cushion to sit higher.  I probably need to look for a new desk!! The back support is good if you sit all the way back but I tend to sit closer to front edge of chair to reach the keyboard as I am doing virtual meetings all day and typing on keyboard during most of my meetings. The support length under thigh is good although I wish the front end could be tilted up a little as it feels like it is sloping down a little and it might be due to not enough cushioning in front.  The arm support is at good height for ergonomics but I tend not to use the arm rests as the height of my desk and level of arm rests don’t allow me to scoot chair in close enough due to my desk style.  I do love being able to fold the arms up for storage when I’m not using it to make more space. I’m not sure if the chair is supposed to rock back or lean back but it took a lot of effort for me to make it lean back.  My 6’ tall husband sat in chair and says it was comfortable and he was able to rock the chair back and forth with no effort.Price was decent- I purchased during Black Friday sale.Easy to assemble, all parts included, no additional tools needed.
