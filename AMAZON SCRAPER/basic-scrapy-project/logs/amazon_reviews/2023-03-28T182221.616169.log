{'asin': 'B09VCR969M', 'text': 'Not a huge gamer but I\'m sort of picky with my mouse feel and size. I tried a few different mice and my previous main mouse was the Glorious Model D, both wired and wireless. It\'s been a great mouse but I found the wireless version battery doesn\'t last more than a day and it\'s been "wired" almost full time. Started to be frustrated with all of the cables on my desk and tried to find another wireless that fit my hand but also wasn\'t super heavy, low latency and had good battery life.From the reviews, the top gaming mouse was the Logitech G Pro X, very expensive but I wanted the lowest latency possible. While the performance of the Pro X was great, the body feel was very cheap and almost like a plastic Easter Eggshell. The body also felt too slick and combined with the extreme lightweight just didn\'t vibe with me.For work I have a Razer v1 Viper wired, it\'s good but the buttons feel slightly mushy, so I didn\'t check Razer for a gaming replacement at first. Later I ended up buying a Razer v1 Viper wireless, and looks like they fixed the buttons, they were very snappy and the latency of the wireless was almost the same as the wired. After such a positive experience, I was going to buy another v1 but with the news of the v2 coming out I held out.From the first out-of-the-box experience with the v2 Viper, I first noticed they removed the dock and there\'s no longer any quick charge ability. Honesly, this isn\'t a big deal, if you need to charge the mouse, just plug it in, and use it. With the dock, it\'s sitting on the stand, taking up space. The mouse is now USB-C which is nice, comes with the same very flexible cable, and the wireless dongle has a nice extender where you can have sitting as close to the mouse as possible (reduces latency).What\'s the biggest change on the mouse? It\'s very noticeable of the weight reduction, it\'s about 12g of difference, but at 58g, it still feels very solid (much better over the Pro X). The body of the mouse is the same as the other Vipers, it\'s slightly rough but doesn\'t feel cheap, fitment is great in my medium hand. It is worth noting Razer had to remove a few features of the v1 Viper in order to reduce weight.One thing is it\'s a solid black mouse, I love the new look. The only indication of any LED\'s is a very small dot right below the mouse wheel, this indicates the battery charge. There\'s no other LED\'s on the mouse so keep that in mind if you\'re looking for matching the keyboard. Another change is the removable of the right side "thumb buttons". The v1 Viper allows for right and left-handed use, but the v2 Viper only has the buttons on the left side (for the right handed user). A nice bonus is the included grips (four pieces, two side stickers, two for the buttons), these are very grippy type of rubber.While I haven\'t owned the v2 Viper wireless long, it has great latency on the wireless side and with the light weight doesn\'t feel any more than my wired mice. The pricing is a bit steep but it\'s on par with other high end gaming mice, I would choose this over the other brands based on the Razer fits my hand the best and has the best click feel.Downsides? The biggest issue is the auto-installer for the Razer software. I\'m sure the software is not too bad but having the prompt every time is frustrating. I often use a Razer mouse for my work laptop and given the security issues, prefer to not see this app auto-execute.', 'title': 'Same feel as the v1 but lighter and less extras', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on May 11, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B09VCR969M', 'text': "I previously used the Razer Viper Ultimate as my main FPS gaming mouse (especially in CS:GO) and have quite a few of them lying around. I love the shape, and prefer it to the Logitech G Pro Wireless shape. I feel like it works much better for my grip (palm/claw hybrid) and hand size (19x10cm). When I saw this mouse come out, I was excited to try it, but still happy with my RVU so I waited a bit for the price to drop. I eventually got it for a great price from an Amazon Warehouse deal and I'm so happy that I did. The build quality is top-notch. All of the buttons feel great. I have no squeaking/creaking/flexing/rattling, etc. The mouse feet glide effortlessly. The reduction in weight also made a huge difference. I can much more easily perform quick flicks, especially 180 degree maneuvers when needed. The lack of RGB means you are going to get much better battery life than the older Viper Ultimate (unless you turned the RGB off). The only minor gripes I have are that it does not support my old Razer charging dock, and I wish it had a power switch rather than a power button, so I don't have to wait a few seconds for it to power off/on. This is still an insanely good mouse.
