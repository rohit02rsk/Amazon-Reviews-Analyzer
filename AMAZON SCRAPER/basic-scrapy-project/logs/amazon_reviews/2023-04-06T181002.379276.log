{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': "I didn't get this for gaming. I needed a backlit keyboard to replace an ancient one and this one has some features similar to the old one.

The keys feel like and old typewriter if anyone out there is old enough to recall those. It makes for very easy typing.That it's not wireless. I like a wireless mouse, but a wireless keyboard is not worth it to me since I'm not actually dragging the wire around like I would with a mouse. Nothing to eat more batteries.What I don't like:The back row of keys do not light up. Not that I have much use for any of them, but it seems weird that they made it so they cannot be seen in the dark.So far, the likes outweigh the don't likes.The mouse. No clue on that. I won't be using it.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don\'t necessarily agree with the "you get what you pay for" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can\'t beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange "tall" type that relocates the "\\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. "#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... "What the hell, it\'s $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.', 'title': 'You cannot get a better keyboard and mouse combo in this price range, I am certain of it.', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 20, 2016', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

I figured I would get the same one but when I looked it up it was 120 dollars that I didn't have.  I saw this one had great reviews and for under 40 dollars I decided to give it a shot.

The lighting is beautiful, I rotate through a few of the different colors and lighting effects.  My favorites are the pastel rainbow, and the mode that slowly fades through each color on a rotation. My one and only complaint would be that the finish on the keys is wearing off.  I've only had this for two months now, and as you can see by my picture, the paint on the WASD and space bar is wearing off in places.  The corners of the 2 and 3 buttons are also wearing off as my nail hits against it when I'm hitting my W key.  But again, I game a LOT, as I said.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'First, this review is for the replacement keyboard. The first one, the space bar didn\'t work, but the style and design are good, I figured I\'d give it another try.Disclaimer, I have not tried as a gaming keyboard functions yet. This review is just for regular keyboard and mouse function.-Pros: Quiet, good feel while typing, keys feel like a mechanical keyboard without the loud clicking, back lighting is descent.  A nice looking unit.The mouse is stylish, and will work good "as is" but you need to download the free driver and suite (suite loads with the driver). once suite is loaded the mouse becomes very adjustable to your needs.-Cons: Had read other buyers say they had same problem with space bar and other other keys. To me, a keyboard should be about typing first, everything else second. Just me. but this second one works is great. Can\'t find anything else to complain about, but again this doesn\'t cover the gaming functions.The mouse. The mouse comes with the LED set to "slow" pulse. so if you don\'t download the driver (suite built in) you have a standard mouse with a red "heart beat" back light (default setting). Yes, the light for the mouse can only be controlled from the suite! As I stated it was free Red Dragon site, and installed quick and easy....on my personal laptop.I work remote now and work on a company computer as well. I usually just pop the USB hub from one to the other.But can\'t put the driver on work computer. Enter mouse with a red "heart beat" light for 8 hours.Good for your personal computer, but probably not for a work environment. Will have to live with it for now.Included instructions are basic at best, and even going on YouTube couldn\'t find a lot of help with what all the programmable/gaming keys could do.-Overall, good value for the price, as my son sent over $120 on his gaming keyboard (SMH).I would just advise to buy "sold by Amazon" as I got my replacement within two days.Updated (09/14/2020) On work computer, running large cad program and multiple file docs, along with other programs. The mouse was very glitchy. I realized running though the USB hub made the mouse commands even moving the cursor  “wait in line” to be executed. Not a long delay, but long enough to be aggravating. Computer is brand new, top self HP. So not the computer. Never had this problem with my wireless trackball mouse, with dongle plugged into hub. Not sure if this is all wired mouses or just this one. But I plugged it straight into one of the computers USB ports and now it works fine. Just a heads up.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'If you can spare two USB ports, this set is a fantastic bargain.  Maybe there\'s more customization on more expensive gaming keyboards - this is my first step into the field.  However, everything works great and I honestly have no complaints.  It exceeded my expectations so far (A month or two of use so far).2020 Update:I liked my first Redragon set enough to buy a second set for at work.  The price is still right, and everything still looks and feels great.  A few things have changed, though.The keyboard is now RGB backlit rather than plain unlit keys with red LED embellishments.  There are FN controls to regulate the "breathing" (light-dark pulsing) of the keyboard, which is good because I found it distracting.  The included instruction booklet lists these key combinations.  FN+END pauses and unpauses breathing.  FN+PGDN enables and disables the backlight entirely.  FN+PGUP rotates through 3 still rainbow lighting arrangements.  FN+HOME rotates through 7 monochromatic colors (white, blue, red, green, purple, yellow, and cyan).  FN+INS smoothly transitions through the 7 colors over the course of a few seconds, though to my eyes the brightness was uneven.  FN+UP and FN+DN scale through 4 levels of brightness, and FN+LEFT and FN+RIGHT scale through 4 speeds of animation.For my money, the backlight will be kept motionless on a monochrome light, but to each their own.All told, very happy with the keyboard.  It also features two new sets of buttons above the F-row, which are oddly not backlit.  The set to left of center includes links to My Computer, Search, Refresh, Email, Calculator, and Home Page.  The keys to the right are media controls for Stop, Last Track, Play/Pause, and Next Track.  These are all fine, but unnecessary since the F-row already has FN shortcuts to most of these things, and the topmost row, again, isn\'t backlit.And we have the mouse.  It feels identical to the previous mouse, though it has 4 DPI settings rather than 3.  There\'s a catch though, which is that the mouse backlight (red only) is set to "breathe" by default.  To disable this, you\'ll need to download software from the Redragon support page.  Although my mouse and keyboard both list their parts # as S101-3, the mouse is actually a M601-3 CENTROPHORUS.  You\'ll need to download the drivers for this mouse in order to disable breathing.  All the way left on the software\'s slider will disable the light fully, and all the way right will leave it permanently backlit (my preference).  The other new thing with the mouse is that a LED flashes when you change DPI; it\'s flash speed correlating to how high the DPI is.  It seems unnecessary but harmless.All told, my first impression is that the addition of pulsing lights just makes first time setup harder as you need to track down the software for the mouse and learn the keyboard controls.  I want to take off a half point for the mouse not having a hardware option to disable the light, but all told I\'ll keep my rating at a 5 as the backlit keys are actually an improvement once you learn how to freeze them.*****', 'title': 'Need a super keyboard and mouse for under $30?

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': "Ok, so I bought this keyboard and mouse combo from Red Dragon back in March 2020. I wanted to spend most of my money on the CPU, graphics card, etc... so I didn't have a ton of money to spend on a badass keyboard and mouse. Plus this was the first actual PC I built that didn't run like a potato. When I found this keyboard and mouse combo for only $30, I was shocked and a bit skeptical. I ordered it thinking it was going to be complete crap and would have to upgrade soon after, but I was wrong! Sure if you ask any pro gamers they would say it's crap, but to me, it was and still is (for the most part) amazing. Much nicer than I thought a $30 keyboard and mouse combo would be. I will say that after about one and a half years of ownership (and daily use), the keyboard still works perfectly fine and has no issues whatsoever. The mouse, however, I can't say the same for. The mouse was great I but noticed about a month ago, the rear side button started getting stuck and not working properly. I died a few times in Call of Duty Warzone because of it and couldn't go back to my previous pages when sifting through my web browser. So I decided it was time to throw it away and get an upgrade. Other than that rear side button giving out and getting stuck, the mouse still worked fine, but I decided I wanted an upgrade anyway to a better mouse with customizable RGB lighting. The keyboard has good customizable RGB lighting options but the mouse was always one solid color, red. Overall, this combo is amazing for beginners! Primarily for someone who doesn't want to spend too much money on a keyboard and mouse that can also be used for daily work, school work, and gaming purposes.

I bought this keyboard/mouse set after buying another set for $20.99 on Amazon made by ChonChow (see my 3 stars review there for that) - I almost regretted that purchase because there were more negatives than positives about that keyboard and finally bought this RedDragon after my cat chew through the Chonchow keyboard usb cord last week.  I now wrap my usb cords with aluminum foil - read that cats don\'t like to chew on aluminum foil.The RedDragon costs about 1/3 more than ChonChow but it\'s definitely at least a 1/3 better in build quality and so much easier/more a pleasure to use (keys and typing feels smooth, solid and not too noisy).First, the negatives -(1) only the mouse usb cord is nicely braided (sturdy) and gold plated.  wish the keyboard\'s usb cord had the same quality build.(2) once your PC wakes from hibernate, the keyboard goes back to the factory default setting for breathing rainbow lights mode.  It should not do this, it should simply go back to whatever lighting mode you had it before the computer went to sleep.(3)  please add the ability to also turn off the mouse\'s light, and the lights for both the keyboard and mouse will go to sleep/auto sleep when they are not use for a period of time (like over 10 minutes), or when you put the PC to sleep.(4)  the instruction booklet is VERY minimal - the bare bones way they tell you how to change lighting effect etc. any non expert keyboard gamer would have trouble figuring out.  How do you interpret "<1>FN+DEL"?  Do you actually need to press the "<"? etc.?(5) this was shipped to me in its box, unprotected by an outer Amazon box, which is a little worrisome since the mail service can sometimes be rough with packages, and there\'s not much protecting the keyboard inside except one thin layer of bubble wrap (mine was fine but I\'m sure others may get damaged boxes).The GOOD -Reasonable price for overall quality build ($30 for keyboard, mouse and mouse bad).LONG usb cords for mouse and keyboard (they say it\'s 5 feet long  but seems +6feet!).  As you can see from my ChonChow keyboard review, their claim of 5 feet is rather short and barely could reach from the desk directly below to the PC under the desk.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'I use my keyboard anywhere from 8-16 hours a day most days.  I work in a dimly lit room at night and need a backlit keyboard that I can see, but doesn\'t blind me, and that will last.  Others I\'ve had in the past had painted keycaps that would wear off within 6 months to a year.  I purchased a different brand before I bought this one, then gave the other one away because the backlight wouldn\'t stay on due to an unadvertised "auto-off" feature that could not be disabled.This keybaord is perfect for me.  I love the backlight. There are several modes, but I always set it to a single color and choose my preferred brightness.  It\'s bright enough without being obnoxious, but it can be turned up to be very bright if you wish.  The keys are average height, they are fairly quiet; they do make noise, but it\'s not the super loud clacky noise that some keyboards make.  The media buttons work well, but are unobtrusive and require no extra drivers or software.I love this keyboard, and my only nitpick is one of style:  Many keys have an alternate function via the function key.  The symbol representing the alternate function is printed at the BOTTOM of each key, meaning the primary function of these keys is printed at the top of the keys.  Due to the angle at which you see the keyboard (since it\'s in front of you) the bottom half othe keys are better lit than the top of the keys, so the alternate functions show up better than the primary functions of the keys.  For example, on the arrow keys, the alternate functions for backlight brightness are perfectly backlit, while the arrows themselves are dim.  While this is a minor nitpick, I would prefer to have hte primary function on the bottom of the keys with the alternate function printed above.All in all, even with my nitpick I would definitely buy this keyboard again.', 'title': 'Excellent keyboard for gaming or programming', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 8, 2021', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

I don't like the goofy holes where your thumb rests, I don't like the heavy texture on the buttons.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': "I've had this keyboard for awhile because I needed a a new one that was a bit quieter so I don't wake anyone in the house while working or gaming at night. Overall this keyboard does the job in regards to that. The main issues I have are the size of the keyboard and the lights.The keyboard is a bit too small for my hands and gets uncomfortable to use after awhile.As for the lights? The main issue I have is that it always resets itself to the rainbow nonsense every time you turn your computer off and back on. Yes its easy to set the lights back to what you want but I just want the light to remain on the setting I put it on.The last issue I have is that for whatever reason, if I need to restart my PC, the keyboard stops working and I have to unplug it and plug it back in. I've tried different USB ports and even test my USB ports and settings in my BIOS to see if it was a port issue and its not. Its just this keyboard.So overall all I can say is that my issues could just be localized to the one I bought and my own personal feelings towards it. If you have smaller hands and you don't care about the lights resetting every time you turn your PC on then buy this keyboard. As for the mouse, I haven't used it.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'This is a normal keyboard.  I bought in anticipation of replacing another keyboard that was giving me problems.  About 30 days later my old keyboard, was having a problem with a few keys including the return key and I was happy to have this keyboard ready.  I thought it would have some ergonomic qualities.  It has little legs you can set up to change the angle of the keyboard and that is about the extent of its ergonomic characteristics.  The keys are super smooth, so they are a little slippery for me.  My hands are a little on the dry side.  I bought this keyboard, because I thought it was a good deal for an ergonomic keyboard and did not really pay too much attention to the gaming aspect of it.  It has flashing lights that are kind of annoying, but if you read the instruction manual you can adjust them to a single color, flashing and non-flashing or no light at all.  It is very hard to see without a light, though.  Not sure how it will work at night, but I think it will work nicely and in that regard I think it offers something not on my previous keyboard.  In daytime hours it is hard to see the keys, as the characters are not painted on, but are rather are see through .  I would not recommend for anyone  looking for an ergonomic keyboard.  At first I was unhappy with it, but once I figured how to adjust the lights I am okay with it and are actually happy I can use it at night without additional lighting.  The fact that it came with a mouse is an additional bonus, so yeah I would buy again for the price, but I think if I could fight an ergonomic keyboard for the same price I would buy ergonomic.', 'title': 'Good Night Time Use', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 20, 2020', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'This keyboard is ok, but the fact that I can\'t use some 3-key combos like CTRL+ALT+DELETE is a deal breaker for me. I can get them to work, but only if I use the right-side CTRL+ALT. I think SHIFT had this problem too. Well, apparently I use shortcuts involving those control keys a lot, as a professional software engineer.I\'m pretty sure it has to do with the anti-conflict mechanism they setup. Notice the keys on the left side of the keyboard that are underlined. I think those are all part of this group. On the back of the box, it says "25-key rollover".So like, with VS Code for example, if I try to enter a 3-key combo in the shortcut key mapper, it will only take two keys from the left side of the keyboard.So, I\'m not a gamer, and maybe this is somehow good for gaming, I don\'t know; but I kind of doubt it. I would recommend look elsewhere.I can say a couple good things about the keyboard. I did like the light settings they had. They weren\'t too bad. I also like the key layout. I don\'t like where they put the volume keys. They should have made dedicated media keys for those. For me, I only use the volume media keys on keyboards; I don\'t use any of the other media keys. Although I do think the track control keys are nice to have (play/pause, next/prev).I like the fact that it has lights to show Caps Lock and Num Lock. I guess its nice to have "Win Lock" if that\'s something you can do; but I\'ve never heard of it. Maybe that\'s for Scroll Lock?I would almost give this a 3, but like I said, the wonkiness with the control keys is a deal breaker for me. And I did verify this issue 1) happens on multiple computers, and 2) doesn\'t happen with other keyboards.Also, I guess, if this control key issue isn\'t a problem for you, maybe this is an ok deal for the money. But at the end of the day, you need your keys to be reliable, so I would recommend you look elsewhere.

No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.One more item: Redragon makes it VERY clear that software is included with this package. It is most certainly NOT. And they go to great lengths to hide the software from the end user. I have found what I believe to be the software links, but plan to test before I share them here. I will bump up the review one notch if the package works out well over the long haul, but given the mouse issue right out of the gate and the promised software NOT being in the box plus the poor web site support to find the program, I cannot reasonably give Redragon a 5 star rating until these items are corrected.Update: December 2019 - I was able to correct all the issues with that first mouse and the software works just fine. I\'ve since bought this combination of mouse and keyboard 3 more times and had no issues. This truly is a great keyboard/mouse combination and I\'ve made it a standard setup on the 3 gaming systems I\'ve built to date.  Software is indeed on their website but it is a little strange to find - The mouse is on the website as "Redragon M601-3 CENTROPHORUS 3200 DPI Gaming Mouse " and has two downloadable executables - The Windows 10 version works just fine.

I had an old emachines keyboard that I dearly loved, but the print has worn off many keys and some of the keys take considerable pressure to function, so it was time to upgrade. I will be using this for coding and extensive word processing, not gaming, so that\'s what this review is based on.Mouse: The mouse is nice. It\'s got a nice weight. The texture on the buttons gives it a good feel. It glides on the mousepad well with no skips. It\'s plug-and-play, although you need the driver in order to program the extra buttons. (see below) I haven\'t used the DPI switch, since I wont\' need this for my work. The funny little contour points at the back end of the mouse are quite handy for moving the mouse around when selecting large amounts of text. No noticeable delay between click and computer response.Keyboard: The keyboard is ok. I\'m kind of a "banger" when it comes to typing (I press hard on the keys as I type.) But this keyboard makes considerably less noise than my last keyboard... much softer sound and keypress (if that makes any sense). I was hoping to have the static rainbow illumination for the backlight, but haven\'t figured out how to do that yet. (see below) My biggest complaint is that it\'s missing the little notches on the "J" key that I used to use to orient my fingers when I begin typing. It has a notch on the "F" and the "5" on the tenkeys area, but not on the "J".Instructions: This is where this set really fails. A very thick booklet is included with this set, but don\'t get excited. Most of the book is translations. There\'s only about 3-5 pages of instructions, in very small print (I needed to get a magnifier to read them!), and the instructions aren\'t complete. The instructions could be written with more clarity about how to change colors, and the website for downloading drivers isn\'t even listed. AND when you do Google-search and find the website, you\'ll find that the model number on the booklet (and mouse & keyboard) isn\'t the same as the one on the website. (If you read the Q&A for this item, you\'ll see what I mean.)Overall, the instructions are the worst problem with this item. If you can get beyond this, it\'s not a bad set for the price.

The keys have good resistance, footprint and travel.

Over all a solid buy for the cost.As for the mouse, while not the main reason I bought this setup, it seems like a mild afterthought. The plastic is hard and stiff making it feel like it wasn’t finished, the components like buttons, edging and grips are uneven making it feel like it was put together wrong, the weight and over all feel reminds me of a cheap generic stock mouse you would find in a computer lab or office that came with the dell still running windows 7, that’s made to barely serve a purpose. and nothing more. The finish is textured to give a better grip, but unlike the soft almost silicon texture of the keyboard, the surface feels hard and abrasive. Even the “silicon” grips feel like hard plastic.I do appreciate the sensitivity toggle option for the curser. Having duel screens and a higher sensitivity is amazingly helpful. But every time the computer is put to sleep or turned off cutting power to the mouse the setting goes back to the low sensitivity default so every time I have to reset it.Finally my biggest complaint and the reason for the 4 star review is the mouse is so loud and clicky I cant use the mouse with any open mics because it will wash out any other sound coming through.Over all if you just need a solid keyboard or need a mouse and keyboard combo for general use.

I was right, but wrong!  You can have both.  This set is the same price as buying a basic (walmart ie...) type mouse or keyboard for the same price, and you get the flashy RGB. The mouse even has a DPI option which you wont find with most basic mouses out there.It looks great, for me they are also both comfortable and fits my fingers well.The keyboards RGB is easy to figure out, but the mouse is a little different. It defaults with red and while some say you can download software to change this, I have seen others say its only red in this model. I have yet to do so as I'm fine with the red.  The mouse software is listed under a different model number on the manufacturers website, so keep that in mind if you care enough to go hunt it down and try it out.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'This keyboard and mouse combo is a killer deal for the price.  I bought this as a temporary keyboard and mouse as I\'m doing a gaming PC/music production/game development work horse.  I was extremely surprised and impressed with the mouse especially.  I play CSGO mainly (as it is all I can run on this laptop) and I usually don\'t fair all that well, I\'m usually 1:1 on my K/D ratio and within the first 3 games I went well over 2:1 and a significant jump in overall kills using this mouse and keyboard combo.  Point being I haven\'t changed anything about my game play and so from a scientific perspective, this mouse and keyboard setup made all the difference in the world.  The mouse fits well in the palm of your hand and has a nice texture for solid gripping during long game sessions.The accuracy of this mouse is incredible for the price, actually not just for the price, it\'s just that this is an incredible value for the money.  This may end up being a permanent keyboard and mouse for my gaming PC after all.The keyboard is as advertised, RGB back lit and color changing with various options including the ability to choose one solid color.  I actually like the "spectrum" color shifting and I also love the ability to maintain a solid color.  The keys are very quiet (not clacky like a mechanical keyboard) and this is due to the membrane style rather than individual switches like a higher end keyboard such as Razer.  I\'m not saying this is better or even comparing just letting you know this is NOT a mechanical keyboard, if that is your preference do not buy this.  I prefer the silence of the keys and they are extremely responsive, even while gaming.It\'s to be seen as to how long this combo will last but even if I only get a year out of it, at less than $30, it\'s still a solid deal.P.S. The mouse I\'m currently using is a wireless BlackWeb and it\'s about $6 here on Amazon, I actually purchased it from Best Buy about two years ago, and it\'s fine for an all around mouse but for gaming, you definitely need something better such as this combo.  The BlackWeb has a rating of 1600DPI I believe and if I remember correctly this one is double that at it\'s highest setting and it\'s noticeable.  I cannot imagine what a truly high end mouse and keyboard combo say from Razer would do for my gaming.', 'title': 'The mouse fits well in the palm of your hand and has a nice texture for solid gripping during long game sessions', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2017', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

Mouse click is audible, but not super loud like some cheap junk mice. Button clicks are a little sensitive so if you rest your hand on the mouse you might find yourself clicking them on accident.

It has several backlighting settings (7 colors blah blah blah I\'m sure you can read the product data. The backlighting works without other software).

Its a 6 button mouse (2 "regular" mouse buttons, 1 button on the click wheel, 1 just above the click wheel that changes the DPI settings, and 2 buttons in the right hand thumb location.) The mouse has red lights that breath by default (though you can turn this off through somewhat glitchy software that works 1/2 the time. But your hand is covering it when you use it...so it\'ll probably be ok). The USB cord has a braided jacket that feels like it can take alot. It has a weight system that you can customize (personally I use 1 of the weights for a lighter feeling mouse). I have large hands and am right handed, and I like that the mouse fits my hand well. The thumb buttons on the mouse are closer to the desk than some other mice I\'ve used. I use a photo manipulation program often with it and the ability to set DPI higher at the click of a button is pretty useful. It also comes in handy when you run out of space on the desk (because sometimes I have papers, electronics projects etc. that are also on the desk)I\'m curious how long the mouse and keyboard will last (I\'ve had them for just under a month with daily 2-3 hour use at the time of writing this). And I\'m guessing they\'ll last a while due to the cords.Overall: the keyboard takes a touch too much work to press the keys down (personal preference) but seems solid and the lights are fun to play with (though IMO the lights are nice but not essential).

Aside from that though, the keyboard is great.", 'title': "Keys don't light-up completely", 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 9, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'I\'ve only been using it since yesterday, but I am already won over by this keyboard and mouse combo. Now, the M601-3 Centrophorus mouse is great. It\'s heavy, glides smoothly, the buttons are responsive, and the size is just right for my hands. That alone is worth the money, but I\'m not focusing on the mouse in this review, but the keyboard.This keyboard is a delight. Typing on it is comfortable, the keys are sturdy, give a nice tactile response, and aren\'t so loud as to wake sleeping members of the household as I type. There was a time when I could type 130 WPM with zero errors, but for years that number was severely reduced due to a number of issues: carpal tunnel, arthritis, and poorly made keyboards. Right now I\'m typing around 110 WPM with zero errors, and the keyboard isn\'t even breaking a sweat. This is probably the best it will ever get for me, but I am already amazed. I never thought I\'d be able to type this fast ever again, but the keyboard is laid out in such a way, with the keys themselves offering a terrific response that lets my fingers bounce from one key to another without any interference or lag, that I don\'t even feel like I\'m straining at keeping up the pace.I realize this isn\'t a mechanical keyboard, but it does feel like one. I mean, if you can\'t afford a mechanical keyboard, the Redragon Harpe K503RGB is a fantastic deal, and I haven\'t even got to the fun part yet: the lights!As you know from the description, the keyboard lights up in a rainbow pattern, as well as 7 colors, including my two favorites: purple, and white. It also has a spectrum option which shows a steady rainbow that doesn\'t blink, or you can have one that "breathes." It\'s all rather lovely, and it\'s a dream for me to type at night. I touch type, but sometimes you need to see the keys, even in the dark, and I have no trouble seeing where my hands are placed, or where I\'m going while I\'m typing at night.All in all, I got this combo for a steal. $30? It\'s easily worth twice that much, IMO. As a budget gamer, I never thought I\'d be able to afford a keyboard and mouse with this kind of quality. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn\'t have a lot of money, but would like to be productive as a gamer, as a typist, and as a general computer user.5 out of 5 Stars. Buy it.', 'title': 'A Keyboard of Many Colors', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 29, 2017', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': "ok first off I did not buy this for gaming i needed a new keyboard because a cat decided that my keyboard was a great place to cough up a hairball on my keyboard and I work from home.  well after the dogs ate the hairball off the keys I found the left over mess and got to work.  After popping off the keys and doing a  cleaning the L P and space bar were all sticking.  like it took me 5 min to type the word approve because of that letter P.  So i ordered this keyboard 1. the price. 2. the pretty lights on the keys and 3 it could be shipped the next day and work wouldn't be that interrupted.So I get the keyboard after struggling at work all day I excitedly connected it and tested it out. and OMG the letters G and M were not responding on the new key board....(insert allot of screaming yelling temper tantrum and foul language)  I set up for an exchange with amazon the next morning they told me my replacement would take 2 days... I couldn't do it... I cancelled the replacement logged into best buy and ordered the same keyboard from them but I was able to pick it up the same day on my lunch hour.I got the exact same keyboard I had ordered for the same price and EVERYTHING works beautifully!  the only issue is i wish the keyboard was more to the right but that's more of how my work space is set up than the item.  So I'm giving this keyboard 3 starts because the first one I had was faulty but the 2nd one works great.. but remember I am not gaming just data entry so I do not need the speed of a gaming keyboard so it wouldn't really be fair for me to comment on that.", 'title': "keys didn't work", 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 4, 2021', 'verified': True, 'rating': '3.0'}

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'I LOVE this keyboard. It\'s absolutely perfect. Now, I\'ve always been a PC gamer, but I\'ve never purchased a gaming keyboard or mouse. . My first keyboard was just a plain black Logitech keyboard that I\'ve owned for five years, and my mouse was a trackball. Now see, I\'ve always wanted a keyboard that glows. The Alienware keyboards looked so beautiful with the ability to customize the colors. But I guess I decided..Why do I need that? I\'ve been typing ever since I was a child. I have the locations of every key memorized. I don\'t even have to look down anymore. Eventually, I found the mouse and figured I\'d give it a try. My finger was just getting ready to hit "Proceed to checkout" when all of a sudden, I saw this combo.So I figured..Why not kill two birds with one stone?The set finally arrived after a dramatic week of waiting. I\'ll tell you right now..When I opened the box from Amazon, and pulled out the case, I was absolutely ecstatic! After I opened the box, I spent a good ten minutes admiring the set, clicking the mouse, and feeling it in my hands. The braided cord was an excellent touch I\'ve never seen attempted before. But when I plugged the keyboard and mouse in, I knew that I was inlove with this set. The product images don\'t do well to represent the backlight. It\'s a lot brighter than I expected, which I love(Remember, I wanted a keyboard with glowing keys). But the mouse has the best glow to it! Anyway, it has three DPI settings on the mouse which has proven very helpful in FPS games. And it has two side buttons, which I haven\'t experimented with yet, BUT I notice that either them act as a "Go back one page" and "Go forward one page". Even more convenient is that I can open a new tab in Firefox by clicking the scroll wheel.I have to get used to the raised keys, as well as using a mouse instead of a trackball. And of course, there are the numerous multimedia keys. The "enter\' button is a bit farther like the others have mentioned, but I honestly don\'t find that a con. It\'s something that I immediately got used to upon using it.In conclusion, I love it. I thought I\'d immediately regret this purchase, but I just don\'t. I love this keyboard, and the mouse is spectacular.', 'title': 'Best first gaming keyboard&mouse', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 27, 2015', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'For, what I\'d call, an "entry level" set, inexpensive, fairly solid with good feedback on keys and DPI on mouse.I\'ll give ReDragon props for flashy.  This is one flashy keyboard, the solid backlight setting is great, especially gaming in low-light. I still have attempted the "changes color with each keystroke" but would likely be a strobe effect.Warning: There is no downloadable software, all the settings are manually done at the Keyboard or Mouse. The only reason I can\'t give it a 5-star. This is why it is a good entry level gaming setup. No macros to program, it would be up to the game to keymap, but macros are out. The DPI setting on the mouse resets each time you shutdown/restart the computer, so you just need to click the DPI selection button. Same goes with the Keyboard, the FN Home, or FN END will change the backlighting. The instructions have a page on which each does.I\'m not a fan of the "no memory" aspect of the keyboard and mouse, but the cable length, funcitionality and feel of the keyboard, a well weighted full sized mouse. Oh, cable length is good to longer than expected, I think about 5\'. The mouse cable is braided.It\'s really not a bad set, I might get one of ReDragon\'s higher end KB/Mouse over the more "common" brands out there. Sometimes you just need a flashy keyboard and mouse and don\'t want to spend a ton on something else that is really only marginally better than this one. :-)', 'title': 'Good response and feel of keyboard/mouse', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 4, 2020', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': 'This keyboard and mouse work. They\'re perfectly serviceable. The light options on the keyboard are nice. That\'s the extent of the good things I can say about this set, unfortunately.To start with, the mouse. I thought I was getting a five-button gaming mouse (not including scroll wheel): I did not. The two side buttons are MACRO playback buttons that require Redragon\'s propriety and obviously-machine-translated software to function. The macro function sucks because it doesn\'t have good manual editing; you cannot type in a set of instructions to push X button at Y time, etc, etc, the way you could with AutoHotKey. You have to record all the keystrokes in the correct order and manually edit the timing/delete anything. But you cannot add!You CAN assign the side buttons - and, for that matter, the regular Mouse1 and Mouse2 buttons - to other keys. However, you CANNOT simply assign them to, say, Mouse3 or Mouse4, as those options are anomalously missing. You may only assign it to Left or Right Mouse, or a bunch of special windows keys like IE Forward/Back, Multimedia, Mouse1/Mouse2, Internet Explorer special keys, and the like.The middle button, below the mousewheel and between the left and right mouse keys, is not a mouse button! ALL it does is swap between one of four programmable mouse input DPI steps. This seems mostly superflous to me, as you can set the mouse\'s DPI in the software. I wouldn\'t mind so much if "switch between DPI settings" was an OPTION and I could reclaim that button for, say, Mouse5, but nope! That is absolutely, positively ALL it does.The keyboard has some FANCY light options, I\'ll give it that. The instruction book is reasonably helpful at explaining them all, too. Annoyingly, they\'re only a set of input-based options from the keyboard\'s own function key, and NOT programmable via the software - which has nothing at all to do with the keyboard. Furthermore, the mouse only has one color - red - and you can only choose between light on, light off, and if it is on, change the speed of the mouse light\'s breathing. These products are obviously not made as partners, they\'re just two different products manufactured by the same company and sold as a set.The keyboard, also, feels cheap. See also the damage on the S, D, N, M, and . keys in my picture above. I have only had this keyboard about six months (arrived mid-April 2019, photograph taken mid-September 2019, day before the date-of-posting since midnight has just passed as I am typing this,) and it\'s already visibly worn from use. This is the kind of keyboard that\'s made to be unboxed immediately before a PC gaming pro sets down for a tournament, it doesn\'t feel like it\'s going to stand up to two decades of wear and still be functional the way my last keyboard was - and still is, though filthy and with many keys worn physically through. I bought this combo for the mouse, which, speaking of cheapness;The mouse is also bloody cheap, too. It FEELS nice and solid and thunky and heavy in your hand - that\'s because there\'s a bloody great mass of sodding metal weights inside it! You can pull them out to adjust their spacing and numbering if you like, so that\'s nice I guess, but with them all out, if just looks feels like a generic Logitech corded mouse going through a Goth phase.In conclusion, they work, they\'re cheap enough and if you like "gaming" stuff, or dragons, or black, or colors, or fancy rainbow cycling lights and you need to replace either or both of a keyboard or mouse, they\'ll do the job. But do not expect a gaming mouse (it is not,) or a gaming keyboard (it has literally no gaming features whatever.)', 'title': 'Flashy but underwhelming.', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 20, 2019', 'verified': True, 'rating': '2.0'}
