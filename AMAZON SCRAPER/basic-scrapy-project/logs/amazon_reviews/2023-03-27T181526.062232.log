{'asin': 'B09P7ZK4CJ', 'text': "Update: sometimes there will be very notable smear when moving objects in games. It's not always the case, but it's annoying whenever it appears. The situation didn't replicate itself on the original screen of my laptop, so I'll assume it's the monitor's fault.=======================================================So I bought two of these monitors to build a dual monitor setup. Long story short, as monitors, they work not badly so far, in the standard of a non-professional user. The picture was blurry at first, but then I noticed that I simply forgot to remove the plastic film on it.They worked just as great as my old ASUS monitor, or I guess so. My old one's been broken for a long time and I can't really compare them anyway. I connected one monitor with HDMI and another with a mini DP port. The mini DP-connected monitor seems to support 165 HZ, which I have no idea whether it's because individual product differences or because I connected with DP instead of HDMI.There are no major issues so far, but there are minor flaws. Not the quality, but the design. First of all, this monitor does not have a built-in speaker, instead, it has a headphone jack. This is no big issue to me since I usually prefer my headphone, but just in case you're building your own PC, you might want separate speakers. It does automatically become your default audio device and is sometimes annoying, but I guess it's not really *this* monitor's issue, but rather a general problem.The second issue is that, remember I said there's plastic film attached to the monitor when it arrives? when you remove it, the bottom of the film is... clamped on the bottom of the monitor. So when the film is removed, you will get a sheet of film that is flat on three sides, but the last side is torn in a jagged shape. Uh, I guess nobody would ever care about this?The third issue, the monitor is kinda thin. Besides the center bottom, this is a thin and big monitor. It's cool when you put it on your table, but my dual monitor setup is installed on a monitor mount. Each time I adjust the angle, I'm worried about damaging it. Not a big deal if you're using the stand included in the package.", 'title': 'More than I would expect', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

But the first monitor I ordered had an awful bug where you could see annoying lines around the screen's surface. It was a different model since it had an extra USB port in the back compared to my first order. So I returned it. After getting the replacement today, I can see the new one is the same model with fewer bugs.I know it's different from the adapter since I tried both old and new screens with a cheaper and more expensive one twice. And there can't be any severe visual issues since my gaming laptop is perfect.I don't know. But what I can say overall about this product is that it's a very good Black Friday deal.

I contacted the manufacturer to purchase a screen replacement from them but they didn’t not offer any screen replacements for sale. So the hunt for a new monitor began. I initially planned on a 2k but decided to first settle for something a step up from 1080p but not exactly 2k so I went with this 1440p that I came across while browsing online. Have to say I struggled with it at first because many of the settings were grayed out and I couldn’t make any picture adjustments due to that. Turns out I had to shut off HDR mode which honestly was the best choice. I got this monitor just to play some games on my new PS5. (Had to replace the old PS5 because it gave out and Sony wouldn’t replace it unless I admitted to damaging it which I did not, it was a faulty console) and once I figured out how to properly work all of the setting’s, I fell in love with it. The picture quality as well as vibrant colors are beautiful. I’m running up to 120 FPS on games that support 120 for the PS5 at 1440p and I’m impressed. If a 1440p at 120FPS looks this great, then I can hardly wait and see what a 2k from this company looks like. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a good yet inexpensive monitor. Also, I want to point out that the customer service I received was absolutely phenomenal and some of the best I have ever received from any company.

{'asin': 'B09P7ZK4CJ', 'text': 'I purchased this monitor for the purpose of checking out a VA LCD, 1800  curved display panel. This is the first time I have used this type of monitor. I am very satisfied with the picture quality. This monitor is excellent for watching movies and good enough for office work even though it is only has 1080 resolution. I find that the 27 Inch curved panel is less of a strain on your vision than a flat panel.  I am not aware of any distortion due to the curve. This monitor is well suited to general purpose use. The only complaint I have about the monitor I received is that at the time I ordered the monitor, the specification described it featured HDMI and DisplayPort. However, the item I received had HDMI and VGA. If I had seen the VGA specification I probably would NOT have ordered this monitor. I noticed that, as of today, the posted specification does show HDMI / VGA but at a discounted price, which is still a good value. Anyway, I am still happy with just using HDMI since I do not plan to use it much for Gaming, which really does need the DisplayPort video for best operation. Update to my Review: The Seller has provided me with a REFUND which will take my payment down to the discounted price. The Seller apologized for my inconvenience. So, 5 stars to the Seller.', 'title': 'Good value with one limitation', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

I just bought a gaming PC and wanted to get a larger monitor (the smaller one Ive used for work didn’t have the best picture) but I didn’t have the money to get the type of higher end monitor I wanted. Decided to give this brand a try as I was looking for a curved monitor that was more budget friendly.The picture is solid, and I like that I didn’t have to do a lot of adjustments out of the box to make the picture work for me (and not destroy my retinas, lower brightness is my friend).I don’t really know how to describe it in technical terms, but my only negative that I can think of is to me this monitor isn’t as “vibrant” as I’d like. Compared to my TV, the screen is a little dull? It’s very hard to describe, because I do think the image quality is quite good (very impressed with it on the games I play, and it’s perfect for work), but I think it’s maybe the backlighting that’s not as bold as I’d like it to be? I do not think it detracts from the performance of the monitor, it just doesn’t pop as much as I’d like.I’m very happy with this monitor, took a gamble on a brand I was not familiar with and I’m quite impressed.

I connected these up with Display Port, and to my surprise, the native resolution wasn\'t 1920x1080p. Instead, it was 1024x768 or 800x600. HDMI connection worked just fine, but Display Port no. Display Port didn\'t even recognize the monitor name like HDMI did. So, I ordered two replacement monitors. While waiting, I thought "Let me see if the included DM cables can even run the advertised rates." So I connected my other monitor up to Display Port, and was able to get 2K 240hz . So it was not the cable. While I had my other monitor connected as a third display, the Crua monitor connected with DP all of a sudden allowed 1920x1080p. The native resolution still only said 60hz, so I had to create a profile for 165hz. Super weird, and I had to do the same thing for my other monitor where I connected a third display up with the Display Port cable and my Crua monitor all of a sudden allowed the Display Port resolution to display.This is a pain, and support did not attempt to even reply to my email.
