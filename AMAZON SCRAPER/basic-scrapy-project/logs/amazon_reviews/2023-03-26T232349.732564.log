{'asin': 'B092DF433H', 'text': "Autofull was very responsive to my feedback on how to improve their product. One thing I really appreciated about this chair is that all the screws are in the right places and easy to access, making assembly a breeze. I would definitely buy from them again.The chair itself has excellent lumbar support, which is crucial for anyone who spends long hours sitting down. The memory foam cushion is also very comfortable and molds to your body. The chair has a chunky, sturdy feel to it, and the faux leather is soft and pliable, which hopefully means it won't crack like a harder, shinier faux leather would. Each part of the chair was carefully wrapped in foam to prevent any breakage or damage during shipping.One downside to the chair is that the armrests are quite hard and may crack or peel over time, so it's recommended to purchase soft covers for them. Additionally, the back support can be a bit annoying and pushes you further out from the chair, which then puts the leg support at the back of your knees. The cushion also tends to go flat after a few hours, which can make the chair uncomfortable for extended periods of sitting. However, despite these minor drawbacks, the chair is a great option for those looking for solid lumbar support and comfortable seating.", 'title': 'Comfortable and Sturdy, with Excellent Lumbar Support', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 18, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B092DF433H', 'text': "Update: Okay, so the customer support is outstanding here! Changed back to 5-stars. Replaced the faulty part of my chair very quickly and were more than happy to help.I do like the overall design of the chair and the comfort isn't bad for the price. Lumbar support foam/pillow for the lower back is very nice. I do have a problem with the hydraulic giving out and my chair slowly descending to its lowest setting after sitting in it for a few minutes.  This problem just recently became a problem and it was only minor at first, but now it has stemmed into a pretty big annoyance. I am well below the weight threshold of the chair too so that's not what I believe to be causing this issue.I do like this chair because it is a big step up from my previous chair (arm rest broke and customer support was a ghost for my previous chair.) I am hoping the same doesn't stem from AutoFull and they will at least help out with the replacement base at a minimum since I haven't had the chair for a full year.  It will remain at 3 stars until this remedy is addressed.", 'title': 'Nice chair, but...', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 4, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}
