{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': "I have literally bought 5+ pair of Sennheiser MX-680 over the years, because they sound great, and work for my purposes with same situation Sansa Clip+ MP3 players (way more than 5+) for about 12 years. Both of those devices are rare now, and I am facing the fact that it's time to get into the modern era. I download about 25 podcasts on Sunday to listen to while I toil at my job all week. I have tested and returned several devices in the last month or so, but I have held on to these earbeans. If you have seen or own a set, you know why I refer to them as earbeans. They sound and/or fit better than 3 other wireless sets that I have tried. More consistent bluetooth connections with several devices, and may even sound better than the wired Sennheisers on my gaming laptop... They tend to work their way out of my ears gradually requiring me to push them back in a little after a couple hours, but it beats the alternative of having my ears clogged with silicone ear tips which I don't care for. Weirdest thing I have to complain about is that when I go outdoors, the bluetooth connection gets real flukey. I don't understand it, but when I am indoors or in a car, it's perfect. When I step outside, it's in and out (same with Raycons which I tested at the same time)... Finally, when paired with my Galaxy S8 (yes I am old and don't buy a new phone every year or less), I can't seem to get them loud enough, but I think that's the nanny nature of the phone not wanting to damage one's hearing and not so much the earbeans because they will go much louder on the PC... Take it from someone who will reject anything of questionable quality, these are good. Raycon on the other hand (at $55 more) - going back.", 'title': 'Noob with BlueTooth Earbuds somewhat impressed with these EARBEANS!', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 25, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B08FT3ZMF3', 'text': 'These earbuds are different from most that they don\'t require a rubber plug to sit directly in the ear canal. IF the shape of your ears is compatible, they sit in a bend of the outer ear. The online manual shows and illustration whereby the buds are held "correctly" in a more or less vertical position, and "incorrectly" in a more horizontal position. There\'s no way that the earbuds will provide good sound in my ears in the "correct" position, but luckily the "incorrect" position is fine. I would not expect the full fidelity of a pair of expensive in-ear earbuds, but they are certainly sufficient for casual listening to music, and have sufficient bass and treble response. I especially like that they can be charged in their battery-containing case, and that the case itself can be charged wirelessly with or without the earbuds inside. As far as noise cancellation is concerned, that is not what I purchased these earbuds for, and I would imagine it would not be anywhere nearest effective as something that creates an actual physical seal. I find that I can walk around with them without having to worry about them falling out, but as far as intense physical activity, probably not. Again, it all depends on how well these fit in your ears.', 'title': 'Small, not really "in ear"', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on January 13, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}
