{'asin': 'B0BCNLGVMH', 'text': 'My current office chair broke, and I bought this because it was on sale and I needed something asap. I knew that this chair was not a forever chair when I bought it but I have some pretty big concerns about the structural integrity of this chair.Ok, first the positive. It was easy to assemble, if not a bit cumbersome. If you’ve put together any furniture before then it’s fine. It’s only screws, nothing else. The back feels nice and lumbar support is decent.The negatives. As you can see in the photos, the base, arguably the most important part as far as sturdiness goes, has questionable welding at best. On each of the 5 legs the welding only goes about half way around leaving big gaps. Second, the quality of the weld where the wheels attach just looks like it’ll bend with any resistance. We’ll see though. Additionally, the entire back piece is just plastics, no metal involved at all. When you attach the back to the seat, even when you only slightly tighten the acres the plastic starts crumbling away. I fear that with continued pressure the screws will wear through the plastic. The seat is almost definitely made of particle board and over tightening the screws will likely crack it. The cushioning leaves much to be desired. Next, the arm rests are way too low, if you are tall they are basically useless. At least you can raise them, but seeing as how they are a part of the back, you cannot remove them. Finally, once it is all been assembled, the chair does not seem sturdy and has a bit of a side to side wobble. I am below the posted weight limit of 300 lbs, so there is no reason this chair should give out on me but, I’m concerned.Overall, if you are looking for a chair and you can spend a little more, then you absolutely should do that. I would not recommend this chair at all.I’ll update this as I use it, as I highly suspect something will give out sooner rather than later.', 'title': 'Not the sturdiest', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '2.0'}

So, if you are planning to sit in the chair for more than an hour, plan to put a pillow of cushion on the seat.  I think if the manufacturer spent another $10 on a better cushion, it would have been a good investment on their part.I contacted customer service about the seat tilting forward issue and they wanted a video showing this.  I did a return on the chair.  BEWARE...keep the box as you will need to disassemble the chair and put it back the box to ship it UPS.  You can\'t just go drop off the assembled chair at Kohls.

{'asin': 'B0BCNLGVMH', 'text': 'I will state up front that I am very finicky when it comes to office chairs. Overall, this is a fairly nice product. I’ve assembled a lot of chairs over the years, and the assembly for this one is pretty typical, although there may have been a couple more fasteners than most I’ve done. The only issue I had during assembly was with the four white plastic screw covers that go over the screw holes on the back. The bottom two snapped in fine, but I had to take a razor blade and shave off some of the length of the inserted part of the plastic covers for the two that went in the top holes. In the end, it worked out fine.The bottom cushion is very comfortable and it looks like it will stand up to a lot of daily use. I do wish the seat height would adjust up about another inch beyond where it will go, but it is not a problem. I love that the arms will fold up out of the way. It is rare that I would ever use arms.The chair will rock a little bit front to back, and that actually makes it more comfortable. However, it also has some side-to-side play... not a lot... but I do wish it were a little sturdier. The chair is quite attractive and is fairly priced.', 'title': 'Very Nice Chair But With A Little Side To Side Play', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 14, 2022', 'verified': False, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B0BCNLGVMH', 'text': 'Was in need of a new office chair after the old one at my PC desk broke. This fit the bill well. It arrived very well packed and as described.The chair was very easy to assemble. The instructions had a few typos and grammatical errors, but the pictures were detailed enough to make it easy to put together. It took me about 15 minutes to assemble the chair by myself.The chair feels very stable and is well made. As a bigger guy, I have a hard time finding office chairs where I am not at or over the recommended maximum weight. But at 6\' 2" and 260lbs, I feel comfortable and secure sitting in this chair.While the chair is pretty comfortable, I do have two negatives for the chair. First, the angle of the seat seems to lean forward a bit much for my preference. You can adjust the forward tilt of the chair, but even at its maximum backwards lean, the seat doesn\'t quite lean back far enough for my preference. The second complaint is that after a long time sitting in the chair it can get a little uncomfortable; but this can be true of sitting anywhere for extended periods. The seat cushion is very dense, and it can be little uncomfortable to sit on for long uninterrupted periods of time. Taking some time to stand up and stretch will help to relieve that.Overall, the chair is a good chair, I use it every day and it feels solid.', 'title': 'Nice Solid Office Chair', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 26, 2022', 'verified': False, 'rating': '4.0'}

The black with white accents is incredible in person, the chair is comfortable, and best of all - it can store under your desk without you having to lower it or make it higher, or put it in sideways as I had the unfortunate experience of doing in college.The chair is super easy to assemble - 10-15 minutes at the most.

I am used to leather chairs of black or mahogany color, but this is a very nice welcome for me into the 21st century (I have seen, sat, and worked in these types of chairs before, never one this good looking, and this is the first time that I own this type of design).It is hard to pick what is best about this chair, but I have to say, the way that the arms are put in the upright position is something you will come to love. It is simple, yet eloquent, and just remembering how many times I have snubbed a toe on the wheels of my previous home office chair give me nightmares.

These guys went above & beyond to keep everything well organized and also protected before shipping. Which was immediate good vibes.The overwhelming bit was how many individually wrapped packages there were, i was thinking maybe it'd be difficult to assemble because of that, NOPE. Clear concise directions, just 6 steps ( with some partial steps on some ) they provided everything needed to assemble, which i usually ignore as I have plenty of tools. But the allen key included was of a sturdier sort than is typical. So assembly went smoothly. They also included extra pieces and parts!!! Always appreciated.Took about 25 mins once all the packaging was removed from the various pieces. But it could have been done much sooner, I took my time a bit along the way to try to assemble it as perfectly as possible and of course admire my handiwork ha.

As I've been spending a fair amount of time in front of the computer lately. I got the old one from a big box office retailer, at a price point similar to this chair. There is absolutely no question as to which I prefer. This new chair is excellent, it really shattered my expectations.It moves extremely fluidly across the floor, about the same weight as my previous chair but it is much easier to move due to the wheels and the new chair's overall design being vastly superior. High quality materials went into every aspect of this chair. It does a really good job of having a durable feel, like it's going to last for quite some time but not looking bulky in the slightest.What was surprising to me is the ability to lean back a bit in it, to comfortably rest, fully seated with some solid lower lumbar support and the chair doesn't unintentionally slide back & then you have to readjust and roll yourself forward. You can rock in place, slightly, if you wish, without being inconvenienced. I'd thought for sure with how smoothly it can roll I'd need a mat for it or a rug but it works excellently on just a laminate floor.I apologize for taking up so much of your time and thank you if you've made it this far into my long winded review, I just really like this chair. 10/10", 'title': 'This chair may yet save my posture, wonderful for extended periods of gaming or desk work.', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2022', 'verified': False, 'rating': '5.0'}

I found the video instructions on the product listing to be infinitely useful, and it is how I assembled the chair.Style:The chair has a very good style and appearance. It looks like something you would find in a very modern office setting.Functionality:I use a 59” computer monitor and use a kitchen table for a desk. This product allows me to fold up the arms so I can really scoot into the table. This is one of my favorite features.The chair has about 5 inches of vertical movement that is set with a lever on the right-hand side. This is sufficient for me. This lever can also lock the seat in place so it doesn’t lean back.The chair also has a knob on the bottom front to adjust how easy it is to lean back. This chair has a tendency to keep you upright and it is a good position to be productive, but it’s really not the position I like to be when I am browsing or doing unproductive stuff.Even on the loosest setting, the chair doesn’t lean back very easily. For the leaner, you usually scoot your bottom near the front of the seat to get a good lean in, but because of the design of this chair, it wants to push you upright again. That’s just physics. If you want to really get a good lean, you need to prop your legs up on a table or something else.Comfort:This chair has good lumbar support and it is probably one of the best I’ve seen in office chairs.The overall comfort of the chair isn’t very high. The padding on the seat and arms is pretty thin. If you’re the type that likes to lean on one arm of a chair, your elbow is going to get sore.The worst aspect of this chair is the thinness of the seat cushion. It feels comfortable at first, but after spending some time in the chair, your tailbone feels tired and sore. This is directly related to the amount of cushion on the seat. I ordered an additional seat cushion to see if this improves it.Construction:The construction of this chair is very good and strong. While looking at the product photos online, I was a little nervous that this would be a little on the chincy side. That is not the case and everything is sufficiently solid enough to handle the job. I predict that this chair will last a long time or regular use.Overall, because I like a lot more comfort in my office chairs, I will most likely be replacing this chair soon. If you are more of a sit upright and proper person, this might be the chair for you. Because of this I do not recommend this product.', 'title': 'Not Built for the “Lounger”', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 12, 2022', 'verified': False, 'rating': '3.0'}

{'asin': 'B0BCNLGVMH', 'text': 'After much research, looking on various sites, reading reviews, I concluded this was the chair to buy, especially for the price Amazon had it at ($127).  The chair did arrive late due to a winter storm and that could not be avoided.  It arrived undamaged and well packed.  It was very easy to assemble and the instructions were easy to understand.  Should take about 1/2 hr or less.  This is a very sturdy chair and well designed.  The white with the black material looks great in the room we have it.  Functions perfectly with the adjustable height.  The tilt option is a bit quirky and not as good as my company office chair, but for this price you can’t go wrong.  IKEA was even much more expensive.  This is a great buy.  Supported my 220lb body without any problem.  Definitely recommend.', 'title': 'Really nice chair for the price', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}
