{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': "I didn't get this for gaming. I needed a backlit keyboard to replace an ancient one and this one has some features similar to the old one. The wide wrist rest for one thing. It's not a slim keyboard like the junky ones you get with your new computer. If it were a boat, I'd call it beamy.What I like:It lights up. Pick a color or do what I'm trying and just leaving it at all colors. My eyes feel less strained using the mix.It's quiet without being mushy. The keys feel like and old typewriter if anyone out there is old enough to recall those. It makes for very easy typing.That it's not wireless. I like a wireless mouse, but a wireless keyboard is not worth it to me since I'm not actually dragging the wire around like I would with a mouse. Nothing to eat more batteries.What I don't like:The back row of keys do not light up. Not that I have much use for any of them, but it seems weird that they made it so they cannot be seen in the dark.So far, the likes outweigh the don't likes.The mouse. No clue on that. I won't be using it. I looked at it and it seems to have a lot of buttons to play with, but it would not replace my wireless small mouse that just fits my hand.I would recommend this if you're looking for a decent backlit keyboard. I do have it on a sliding keyboard tray with the back props up and it still has room to slide away. The measurements were not given in the specs so I wasn't sure it would work, but it does.", 'title': "Can't rate gaming so 3 stars for that", 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}
