{'asin': 'B09TZWLFLY', 'text': "First, I bought this for my wife. She uses this for Minecraft, and a few other similar type games, so not a hardcore gamer, but she does like it. She doesn't care for the LED's (although maybe some people only buy it for that) but there is a button to turn them off. However they always turn back on.With all that said, it was a solid buy. Feels solid, and seems well made. My wife's only complaint (aside from the LEDs that don't stay off) is that key travel is a bit long.

You know when it bottoms out but it does it elegantly.Super quiet. Yes, it is a membrane keyboard, but it is quieter than my other membrane keyboards.Very sturdy metal frame. No flexing when I pound on the keys.Anti-ghosting EXCEPT for the X key. Weird.  If you hold down both shift keys and press X, nothing happens.

{'asin': 'B09TZWLFLY', 'text': 'Got this when my last keyboard finally gave up the ghost. I use it for coding, not for gaming, but figured if it was good enough to stand up to gaming then it could handle the daily abuse a coder would put it through. I am very pleased! Keys are very quiet, and have a great feel to them. Also, since the keys are raised above the keyboard bed instead of encased inside it, clean up with a can of air is a breeze. So far, my only criticisms would be: Seems to be an inch to and inch and a half shorter than my old keyboard, so I\'m having to re-learn the keys at times (i keep hitting "C" looking for "V", etc). I\'m sure this is just a "me" thing and will improve over time. Also, the keyboard has a weird habit of turning its backlight back on after I shut down my computer. This is more of an annoyance really.', 'title': 'Overall a very good keyboard', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 23, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B09TZWLFLY', 'text': 'After about 1 week of use:The Good:*This keyboard is quite. The keys strokes are mostly soft and feel light, with most keys having no real click to them.*The Frame is an formed aluminum plate thick enough to give this keyboard a real solid feel.*The keys are positioned over what appears to be a single silicone barrier, meaning I would expect this keyboard to stand up to most simple spill over the stop of the key board.The Bad:*While this keyboard does have LEDs that are a few colors, they are not RGB addressable LEDs. (which is what I had actually searched for [*shaking fist at amazon\'s search engine*]) So you will have no control over which colors the keyboard displays, but only if they are on or off. Now, in all fairness, this is not a strike against the keyboard as it is exactly as advertised, and I should have read the description more carefully, but is still more than a little disappointing.The Ugly:*Nope. So far I have nothing to report as "Ugly".Bottom line: Provided the user wants a keyboard that is back lit with a fixed set of colors, I would recommend this key board to anyone.', 'title': 'Solid keyboard', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on February 2, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}
