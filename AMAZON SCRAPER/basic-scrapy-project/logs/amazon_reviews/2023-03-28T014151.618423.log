{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': "Product is awesome. Works fantastically. No issues at all, and functions as it's supposed to. My only complaint is how it was shipped. It was sent via USPS and not through Amazon itself, which caused a lot of problems. First, the package was way too big to fit inside a mailbox (obviously) but it also could not fit inside a parcel mailbox either, and I was forced to retrieve it from the post office. Items like this are better sent via Amazon's own delivery service, or Fedex, etc. USPS is not designed to deliver large packages. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.", 'title': 'Great keyboard.

{'asin': 'B00NLZUM36', 'text': "Updated after enough use to adequately review 12/10/22:The keys are a tad bit too small. The mouse after one day - right mouse button sticks. I use it to toggle zoom so I don't press and hold it I just tap it. The left button does have a satisfying click and the resolution of the mouse improved gaming performance by an order of magnitude.Interesting but true - see picture - this keyboard has two R keys. The left R key is actually the E key.I can touch type on the keyboard but it takes some getting used to because of the small size of the keys and the smaller than usual spacing. I will live with it for a while but I should have bought a mechanical keyboard.This will definitely improve your gaming performance if you are currently using any form of wireless mouse. I was using Logitech M510 wireless gaming mouse and a Logitech ergonomic keyboard and they both experienced latency and connection issues.Overall very satisfied.", 'title': 'Great Upgrade at Great Price', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on December 9, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}
