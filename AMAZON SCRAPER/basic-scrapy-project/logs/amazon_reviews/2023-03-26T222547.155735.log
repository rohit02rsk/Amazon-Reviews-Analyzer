{'asin': 'B092DF433H', 'text': "Autofull was very responsive to my feedback on how to improve their product. One thing I really appreciated about this chair is that all the screws are in the right places and easy to access, making assembly a breeze. I would definitely buy from them again.The chair itself has excellent lumbar support, which is crucial for anyone who spends long hours sitting down. The memory foam cushion is also very comfortable and molds to your body. The chair has a chunky, sturdy feel to it, and the faux leather is soft and pliable, which hopefully means it won't crack like a harder, shinier faux leather would. Each part of the chair was carefully wrapped in foam to prevent any breakage or damage during shipping.One downside to the chair is that the armrests are quite hard and may crack or peel over time, so it's recommended to purchase soft covers for them. Additionally, the back support can be a bit annoying and pushes you further out from the chair, which then puts the leg support at the back of your knees. The cushion also tends to go flat after a few hours, which can make the chair uncomfortable for extended periods of sitting. However, despite these minor drawbacks, the chair is a great option for those looking for solid lumbar support and comfortable seating.", 'title': 'Comfortable and Sturdy, with Excellent Lumbar Support', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 18, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

Replaced the faulty part of my chair very quickly and were more than happy to help.I do like the overall design of the chair and the comfort isn't bad for the price. Lumbar support foam/pillow for the lower back is very nice. I do have a problem with the hydraulic giving out and my chair slowly descending to its lowest setting after sitting in it for a few minutes.  This problem just recently became a problem and it was only minor at first, but now it has stemmed into a pretty big annoyance. I am well below the weight threshold of the chair too so that's not what I believe to be causing this issue.I do like this chair because it is a big step up from my previous chair (arm rest broke and customer support was a ghost for my previous chair.)

{'asin': 'B092DF433H', 'text': 'So update... I use this chair probably four hours max a day. And the arm of the chair has ripped into two pieces (the rubber portion). It felt quality, but I suppose durability says otherwise.-------------I am someone who really needs to find the best deal that they can. A couple of years ago I bought your "generic" gaming chair and it\'s already lopsided, worn out, and destroying my poor spine. I work from home, as well as game so I need a chair that will support me and also my "pretzel style sitting".Assembly: Honestly, probably one of the easiest chairs I\'ve had to put together. I was trying to put it together on my short breaks while working, and even not until later figuring out that there are in fact English instructions, I had it going easy peasy just from the pictures alone. I like that they really have all the screws where you need them to be, and loose so you just remove them, add the part, and put them back in. As a 125lbs out-of-shape lady, I had absolutely zero issue putting it together. I ended up propping it upside down on a backless kitchen table chair and it worked wonders.P.S. All of the parts seem of really good quality!It\'s hard to give an accurate time because I worked on it 20 minutes which mostly was me taking it out of the wrapping/protection which was actually packed VERY nicely.  7 or so minutes one other time -- and when I got off work it probably took me about 25 minutes or so to get everything together, flip it over and sit down.Day 1 Review:It is definitely low to the ground, but it\'s probably the first chair that I\'ve ever sat in that makes me want to NOT sit pretzel style. Not because it isn\'t comfortable, but because it seems to want to encourage you to sit proper. The back pillow as of right now, is a 10/10 and feels amazing. I can only hope after living in the chair for a while it remains that way.To put into perspective, I am 5\'3" as well, and I would *love* for this chair to be about an inch taller than what it is but I\'ll figure out a way to make it work, maybe a mat. I would be curious as well to see someone of a larger stature sit in the chair - though I wouldn\'t necessarily question it\'s sturdiness because it seems to be well made. I feel it caters perfectly to us short folks, aside from the little height issue.So far, I have zero regrets in purchasing this chair. I truly hope it holds up.I can genuinely tell you however that it is already much higher quality than those gaming chairs that all mimic one another in the $100-$200 range.

{'asin': 'B092DF433H', 'text': 'I bought this chair to replace a love-seat in my travel trailer.  I\'ve had it for a few weeks now and use it every day for a least a couple of hours.5 stars - SHIPPING:  It arrived before I expected and in perfect condition.4.9 stars ASSEMBLY:The instructions are very difficult to read.  I have decent eyesight but the very fine print in red ink over a blackish background was just a poor choice and it really slowed the process for me.  I had to use the camera on my phone to zoom in on a great deal of the instructions.This chair is heavy and that is a good thing!  I would recommend that smaller individuals or anybody with back, knee, shoulder issues  etc, have someone help with assembly.  It will require flipping over and you will find it easier if you have something of sufficient hight to rest it on during the process.  The bolts came pre-installed on my chair which made assembly fairly intuitive.  Assembly is by no means intimidating for this chair.4.5 stars - FEATURES:Pros:Sturdy. this chair is no joke.Comfortable. Comfort is a subjective experience but I\'ve had no issues.  I do not use the included backrest.It definitely reclines 180 degrees.Con-"ish"s:No fine-point control for recline.Foot rest extension length was an issue for me.  I am 6ft tall, 185lbs and my legs extended well beyond the foot rest.  For me the foot rest was almost a lower calf rest.  I modified the extension bars and now I have no issues.  The bars that come with the chair are actually hollow, at least mine are.  Now, I\'m not recommending you do what I did but here\'s what I did:  I bought a 1/2" thread tapping wrench and two 1/2" threaded steel bolts (10.5" long, you can find them longer) from a local hardware store.  I popped the caps off of the supplied bars, threaded them,  then connected the bolts accordingly.  Works perfect for me.  The thread tapping wrench, cost $15 bucks, the bolts...

The back support thing you see in the photos, that's a pillow you put on the chair it's not part of it. Honestly I think the pillow makes the chair even less comfortable when used ad designed, however I do use it all the time on the bottom of the seat to raise me up so it's more comfortable for my butt and thighs.

The footrest is great though, if not for that I would HATE this chair. It let's me sit in lots of different positions and relax the way I want.

I ordered better casters that roll quietly but any movement while sitting creates the WORST creaking sound from the main hinge, see video. The chair will NOT keep you cool, at all, as this material is not breathable. If you're looking for a cooling, breathable type chair this is not the one for you. The arm rests are mediocre, hard and will likely crack and peel over time so buy soft covers. If you're tall, the leg support will come to about the top of your calves and back of the knees. Neck pillow works fine. Back support is a bit annoying and makes you sit even further out which then puts the leg support at the back of your knees. Because of this I do not use the back lumbar support pad.  Final thoughts - looks great, comfort is very firm and mediocre, durability, TBD, customer support, TBD. Hey Autofull support, let's discuss this obnoxious creaking sound.2-month update - the noisiest chair I have ever owned. Now, this thing creaks from every metal-to-metal component. It's horrible noise and it gets so hot sitting in it but that's what you get from a nonbreathable material.Latest Update - Autofull Support is surprisingly great. They will do what is needed to address your issue. They have been very responsive and plan to send a replacement... I just hope this next one does not have the same obnoxious creaking problem. Glad I'm not a live streamer. Thanks, AutoFull support, so far so good to your attention on the matter. FYI.. this is how this chair sounds today (see vid) when I move forward and back. Kind of crazy for a new chair. O.o", 'title': 'Not impressed', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 17, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '2.0'}

The product description for the chair states the sitting area has a width of 19.7", it does not. Roughly 4.5" of that 19.7" is from the "wings" of the racing style seat. These wings have very little padding and have metal frames running through them. So, when you\'re sitting on the "sitting area" which is actually 15.25" your thighs are pressed up against these metal, barely padded bars. This is incredibly uncomfortable after an hour or so and quite painful after a few hours.Overall, the quality of the chair is good, actually better than I had expected, but unless you are very skinny, I\'d recommend looking elsewhere.On a side note, the footrest doesn\'t really extend far enough to be useful unless you are in a completely reclined position.', 'title': 'Not a bad chair except...', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 10, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '3.0'}

{'asin': 'B092DF433H', 'text': "This chair was a Christmas gift and my husband put it together for me, so can not speak to the assembly side of it, but he did say that it was easy to put together. This chair was to replace a cheaper gaming chair that I purchased that one wheel broke off of in less than a year. Love the lumbar pillow that comes with it, just wish there was some sort of strap to hold it in place so it doesn't fall down when I get up. I am a Data Engineer, working remotely, so I spend a lot of time in my computer chair and need one that is comfortable and supportive. This chair fits all my needs, plus some! One thing that is a little annoying is that the armrests turn too easily sometimes and you have to move them back into place.", 'title': 'Super Comfortable...', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B092DF433H', 'text': 'I really liked almost everything about this chair, but for one design flaw: the front edge of the wings on the sides of the seat base can really hurt your legs if you\'re not very narrow.  I\'m sorta wider hipped, and after using this chair for 3 days, I had sore spots on both thighs where the front edge of the wings (which is padded but firm metal) was biting into my legs.  Double-check your required seat width dimensions before purchasing this chair.  I believe the seat base was about 18" across, but don\'t quote me on that.Other than that, it\'s a great chair: solidly built, not too hard to assemble, liked the footrest and the tilt.  I think it\'s a little "over-labeled" with the producer\'s graphics, but good value for this price point.  Just make sure it\'s not too narrow for your butt and legs before you pull the trigger on this one.
