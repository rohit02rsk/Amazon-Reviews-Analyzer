{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': 'I\'m a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers. I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody\'s\' ears are different. Like, they\'re physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there\'s also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it\'s a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn\'t affect the headphone\'s performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn\'t affect the headphone\'s performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I\'ve purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of "thump" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I\'ve put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they\'re using some processing trickery to make it sound like it\'s playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they\'re never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit "dark" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It\'s only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it\'s expected that imaging won\'t be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM\'s) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM\'s is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM\'s can use armature drivers where \'can\' style headphones like this can\'t use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, "pressure" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it\'s not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I\'ve tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with "pressure" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.', 'title': "Not bad, but I expected a little better if I'm honest.", 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': "I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes!  I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 Â¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.", 'title': 'Sony never disappoints!', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': 'What can I say, these headphones are amazing.  The noise cancelling ability is incredible and they are definitely audiophile quality in the sound department.  They come in a plain but nice protective case that includes a small 3.5 mm male to male jack and a type c to usb cable that is very short.  The Sony Connect app really helps get the most out of these headphones.  I just recently set up the 360 degree sound feature for these which really improves the sound experience on songs recorded with that feature.  I also really like the equalizer included in the app.  I use these headphones via Bluetooth from an iPhone 14 and the Amazon Unlimited HD app.  Most songs sound fantastic and the volume is for the greater part sufficient.  The majority of well sonically engineered songs are reproduced with stunning bass , smooth/detailed mids and extended highs.  There are some songs that just are not produced as well and those can sound a bit anemic even with the bass on the eq maxed out.  But this is a matter of the sonic quality of the source material and not the headphones themselves.  I think the Bluetooth quality is exceptional and I canât tell the difference between wireless and hardwired.  I also plugged the headphones into my computer for testing and the volume went way higher then with my iPhone.  It was actually louder than I could stand so these headphones can handle high volumes without noticeable distortion.  I would not recommend listening at high volumes for extended periods of time if you value your hearing in the long term.  I have not really activated or played around with the adaptive environmental features yet on the Sony app.  Also, the phones mute when I talk and it pauses the source I am listening to.  When I am done talking it resumes automatically.  I am really happy with these headphones and feel they are a great value considering what they are capable of doing.  I might also add that they are very lightweight and surprisingly comfortable to wear even for extended listening sessions.  I had them on last night for 4 hours straight and although I knew they were on my head, they never felt uncomfortable or obtrusive.  As a final note, I like their plain, unassuming look.  I donât need fancy looks, just give me top tier music  reproduction and I am happy.', 'title': 'Awesome Headphones', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': "I have just recieved these today so this is a first look at them. My primary uses for this headset is for meetings and language learning. I do use them with music, but its less important.I am upgrading from a set of Plantronics 8200. The Plantornics were good headphones at about half the price. By comparison, the Sony headset has a more balanced sound. The Plantronics had a pronounced bass bump. They would probably be an excellent headset for those who enjoy bass heavy music, they definitely thump. The WH-1000XM5 is able to produce deep bass but they are even across the frequency range. This does not really affect voice reproduction so much as playing music. I personally prefer to hear music reproduced as closely as possible to how it was mixed.  So this is a win for me. They also have greater detail than the Plantronics had.In meetings these headphones do a fine job. My voice is cleanly reproduced at an excellent volume. The voices of other speakers are reproduced cleanly and without coloration.For language learning these headphones are excellent. I listen to Chinese movies. With the Plantronics, it would sometimes be difficult to hear all the syllables clearly. These have no issue reproducing those syllables cleanly and clearly. I have no issues resolving the syllables in the movies.General thoughts. The volume produced by the headphones is excellent. I am able to listen at a lower volume than I could with the Plantronics. In addition, they have no problem cranking out volume when it's needed, again, cleanly and clearly. The noise canceling is a huge upgrade from the Plantronics. I have not people speaking around me. I have had fan and air conditioning noise. These would come through clearly with the Plantronics but are only noticeable with no sound through the headphones. Even then, these noises are almost completely inaudible. The ear pads are more comnfortable than the Plantronics. The Plantronics would ride on my ears and cause irritation when worn for long periods.Overall. I really questioned if it was worth investing in these headphones. My Plantronics were purchased by my employer. I bought these out of my own pocket. For my purposes, these are worth it, I will keep them.", 'title': 'Excellent headset', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': 'I read the reviews from those claiming professional audio experience with considerable respect and anticipation.  I enjoy high quality music components - my taste has always been heavily rooted in 70âs Rock.As a drummer, and a serious music collector, I still enjoy the drive, spectrum, and talent that produces each part of the music - even though it is now rarely evident in todayâs world of ânoiseâ.I used a set of Bose QC35 headphones as my means of listening to music while mowing grass on my ZTR.  These worked sufficiently while also giving an impressive rendering of music fidelity - all things being considered.After a few years I wanted to see if an upgraded setup was available  - so the research, shopping, and review reading led me to buy these Sonys - despite that brand name not being one commonly associated with HQ headsets in the audiophile realm.Honestly - âoverallâ - It has been a disappointing decision made thus far.  I get the feeling that the ANC is where the tech was implemented, not necessarily in the fidelity, styling, or sound drive.Other reviews adequately describe the somewhat cheap materials used.  The lack of any manual buttons or controls on the set, coupled with the total lack of any printed manual is cheap IMO.  Its case and packaging appear to be recycled - as a demonstration of Sonyâs participation in the myth of climate change - so the tech stuff like âduo CPU and 8 micsâ thing - gets a little drowned out.The folks at Bose use to piss everyone off in refusing to publish specs. They would reply âjust give our speakers a listenâ.  And to a large extent - I think that applies here.These headphones do have a very good frequency spectrum , SNR, and although I have not thoroughly tested it yet - Iâd bet the ANC works very well.The minimalist will love the flat black (or silver) shaved exterior.  The one little paper included in the box (besides ads and the warranty) is a safety sheet that only lists ALL the MANY THINGS you should NOT do with them.  Nothing is written inside to say how they can be used or enjoyed.You must download the âCONNECTâ app, create an account, and use the phone app to set up and control the headphones. NOTHING is possible without doing that.  (One more tether to tie you to your phone).Of course you read the terms and agreement when you open your account too - (and they wouldnât dare use any of your PI, nor would your privacy ever be invaded).So I listened to the sound - and it is as good - perhaps a tiny bit better - than my Bose.But at a much higher cost - AND not until signing up & using the app to adjust the Sound. They are very lifeless without setting up the equalizer AND pushing the volume to FULL. This is a must.Iâm not sure they even have the volume output of the Bose.  That is a major concern to me due to my particular use - AND that I do like music to be fairly loud (and clear).Lastly, iPhone users - if you donât play the game of getting the latest iOs revisions, certain functionality may not be provided.  So iPhone users be sure to check on that.With such a price tag - and so many ties to endure - to gain and maintain full functionality with these, it may keep âfence sittersâ like myself from returning them (after going through so much just to test them out).âOthersâ - who seem so thrilled - throwing 5 star reviews on everything they try, (and probably listening to compressed MP3 formats) will give Sony the goAhead on these.  But I am not so thrilled.  I like quality to be in all aspects of the equipment. And I like the USER to be in full control.There may be more to what Sony is getting here - than their customers.', 'title': 'Not worth the cost', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '3.0'}

I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summerâs here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. Itâs like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, âindustry-leading noise cancellation.â And they ainât lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that  - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. Itâs pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, itâs like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You donât have to do anything. It knows if youâre sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably wonât completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. Iâve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but theyâve improved the fit with a  new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you donât want to hear.There were a few other design changes â the XM5s arenât foldable like the XM4s, and thereâs a redesigned case thatâs collapsible to save room in your bag when youâre wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, youâll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Muskâs rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and youâre in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? Thatâs so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But â how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. Thatâs important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably wonât have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass thatâs necessary in most of todayâs popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded âmuddyâ with some music. I didnât notice that, but Iâm a producer and Iâm familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldnât tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. Theyâre actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. Iâve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldnât tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things youâll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh â and thereâs Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. Thatâs a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If youâre moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so theyâre probably worth looking into. If youâre done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, itâs a no-brainer.", 'title': 'UNBELIEVABLE carbon fiber sound quality, improved ANC with 2 processors and 8 improved mics', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2022', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': 'I was hesitant to even consider these headphones because the idea of spending several hundred dollars for headphones seems outrageous.  However, I had the opportunity to try on someoneâs AirPod Max and was blown away by the noise cancellation.  My work requires a lot of focus, and I find I am easily distracted by even the most subtle noises.. background talking, laptop fan spinning up, ambient noises, etc..  So I justified this purchase as a way to help me stay productive with work, and it absolutely has been delivering on that hope!  After researching the pros and cons of the different options in that general price range, I determined that these seemed like the best fit for me.  They are considerably lighter than the Max, and the noise cancellation at least as good, if not better than the Max.  The price, while still a lot of money, is also considerably cheaper than Max.  These are super comfortable for my ears, which was a relief because I am typically very sensitive to wearing any kind of over-ear headphones.  The battery life almost seems too good to be true (but itâs not - you really do get 30 hours on a charge), which is another big plus for me.  Iâve read reviews saying the sound quality isnât quite on par with the Max, but I honestly canât tell the difference.  Iâm not an audiophile, but I do have a fair amount of experience with audio equipment, and I feel these do an excellent job.  The closest to any negative feedback I could give on these headphones is that Iâm not a fan of touch surface interfaces (touching the right ear-piece letâs you pause/play with double taps, swipe left/right for next/prev track, and up/down for volume.  For my taste, touch interfaces are unnecessary and actually less intuitive/user-friendly than good old fashioned buttons, but thatâs just my opinion.  Also, double tapping to play/pause, no matter how softly I do it, kinda creates a very loud booming sound which I find unpleasant.  That said, I donât find I need to mess with those controls much anyways.

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': 'I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4âs for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5âs. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5âs have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think Iâd give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isnât a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So itâs a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, Iâm going to be using the Sonys from now on.', 'title': 'Comparison to Bose NC700', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': "First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is  icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.", 'title': 'Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '5.0'}

{'asin': 'B09XSDMT4F', 'text': 'If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if youâre playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldnât rate the âSurround Soundâ/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, itâs amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Dutyâ¦ or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesnât work while itâs charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasnât lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I donât plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. Itâs just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you canât deny the microphone quality. Itâs quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top itâs gold. If there was once feature they shouldâve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. Iâm not left handed but it would increase usability since I donât always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, itâs a good product, just a tad overpriced. Letâs see how long I can keep it alive.', 'title': 'Itâs not 100% Noise Cancellation', 'location_and_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023', 'verified': True, 'rating': '4.0'}
